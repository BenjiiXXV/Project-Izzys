ACT TEN: WINDS OF CHANGE

<i>‘Miss Seraph?’ 
Thirza sat in Megan’s chair at the office. Evidently she was aware of the events that had taken place that evening and even though it neared four in the morning there was no sign of exhaustion in her countenance as she sat there, with her back towards the entrance. She had her eyes closed but Valerius did not know that as he could not see her. He heard her breathing, however, and she breathed with a softness he only knew two people used.
‘Miss Seraph?’ he tried again. He had closed the office door behind him without a sound but had not proceeded any further into the room. It seemed without respect to do so, and as he was not sure how Thirza would cope with the recent events he thought it better to show her all the respect she deserved, which was a lot.
‘Judas came by,’ Thirza answered without opening her eyes. It wasn’t a question, and Valerius did not answer. She opened her eyes, turned the chair around and sighed.
‘I thought this would happen,’ she said, looking deep into his eyes even though he was far away.
‘With her reputation, it was bound to happen eventually.’
‘I suppose that’s true. This time it’s my fault, though.’
‘That is a lie.’ His tone had been disrespectful and harsh and he had said it too quickly, but she didn’t seem to mind.
‘It was my plan to use Emma.’
‘It was, but we all assumed Gregory would wage a war on us rather than to run to the police.’
‘Yes, but…’
‘And even if it was your fault – again, which it’s not – I know for a fact that Megan would not hesitate a second before taking the blame for anything you’ve done.’
‘Still…’
‘And it’s not her first time in, is it?’
‘Her fourth, actually, but she’s never been charged with murder.’
‘Let’s not forget she didn’t actually commit the murder. The weapons don’t even match; Megan uses an FN Five-seven from Belgium while Gregory uses a German Walter P99 with pride. His bullets have a diameter that exceeds hers by half her FN bullets. I’m sure the bullets are still in her body and if not, if they did fully go through, they’re still in the bed but the holes won’t match Megan’s gun and there’s no plausible explanation for why she would have Gregory’s gun.’
‘What about why Emma was in our house in the first place?’
‘She’ll figure something out; she’s smart enough for that. Something about Emma being after her, I’d reckon.’ Thirza thought for a moment, unsure what to say.
‘We’ll hear the date of the trial tomorrow, and we can talk to her tomorrow. How about for now we just go get some sleep.’
‘My bed’s a crime scene, I got nowhere to go.’
‘Yeah, it would totally be a shame to use one of the dozen unused bedrooms at my place.’ A smile played with the corners of Thirza’s mouth.
‘Come on,’ said Valerius. ‘I’ll give you a ride.’

Meanwhile in the Sexy Stuns’ basement things had taken a turn for the worse. Gregory sat at his desk, his elbows resting on it and his head in his hands. Tears of rage and sorrow slowly dripped onto the wood surely ruining it but that was the least of his problems at the moment. Loja sat on the couch in the corner, quietly, attempting to comfort George who was crying on her lap. Juine had backed off into a corner quietly unsure what to think or do and merely observed the scene. Mia found herself in a state of disbelief and was overcome by anger. Her fists were clenched and white with tension while her face got redder and redder, her blood was clearly boiling it looked as if she was about to scream so loud the entire city would be shaking on its foundations but instead when she spoke it was barely more than a whisper. No word could be missed, however, and every letter she pronounced was so thoroughly drenched in anger that it terrified George and the Makaine sisters.
‘How could you?’ she whispered as George crawled further into Loja’s arms, scared of what was and what was to come. Gregory knew better than to answer, but he had no choice.
‘I’m sorry,’ he muttered. She snapped.
‘You’re sorry?’ she yelled. Karyme backed off further into the wall and Loja put her hands on George’s ears. ‘You’re fucking sorry?’ Mia continued. ‘Well that’s fucking helpful isn’t it? You fucking murdered you own fucking daughter and you think you can fucking get away with it by saying you’re fucking sorry? How the fuck is that gonna bring back my Emma, Greg? How the fuck do you expect to fix this shit with a fucking apology?’
‘I don’t know,’ Gregory admitted. 
‘You fucking took my daughter!’ Mia bellowed. ‘You’re gonna pay for this, Greg. Mark my words, you’re gonna pay for this.’ She walked over to the couch and dragged George from it and put him in front of his dad, hurting him with her firm grip.
‘Take a good look at your son, you jerk-face, it’s the last time you’ll ever see him. Dead or alive.’ She marched out, dragging George with her who threw a terrified look at Loja. She got up at the sight of it and followed the duo. Gregory pulled his hands through his hair and fell back in his chair.
 ‘God fucking damn it,’ he said exhausted. ‘God fucking damn it all.’<i>
