<!DOCTYPE html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /></head><body class="bloodyeverything"><p  class="intel1">THE RED LOTUS GANG<br><br>The Red Lotus came to Letum in the early 1950s. Back then, being a group of pimps primarily engaged in prostitution, later to become one of the four biggest gangs in the city. As of today, they’re mostly known for their widespread drug distribution and high quality whores dominating the red light district in the city of Letum. They are respected and mostly left alone by other gangs as they are good business partners. The Red Lotus tends to buy large stocks of drugs of various kinds, to sell them as middleman in the whorehouses. Members of The Red Lotus are known not to be good fighters, but moreover addicted to drugs and if assaulted often defenseless. Nowadays their whores tend to be robbed or raped by members of the other gangs as they are behind on payments of  venue and drugs. 983 members.<br><br><br> THE BLACK DRAGONS GANG <br><br>The Black Dragons are all about loyalty and being a family. Originally founded by outcasts looking for acceptance, they quickly grew to be one of the more violent gangs. However, their loyalty standards are unmatched. The gang’s emblem is a mandatory tattoo on the right upper arm,  and  the  only  way out of the gang is to die. Three years ago members stood up against the iron reign of their leader at that time and he was brutally murdered, after which a young female took his place. Ever since major changes have happened in the guild and members feel more at home. Their combat has increased, as has their numbers, and they are now one of the four biggest guilds and known to be best avoided by others. They own many venues, including of which weapon storages of the Phoenix, with which they have a good bond. The black dragons tend to form an alliance with the phoenix gang whenever either wages war. 1253 members.</p><p class="intel1">THE PHOENIX GANG <br><br>The  Phoenix  was  brought  to  life after the anti-gun laws of 1973. They are the largest gun importer and have the most innovative ways to get guns into the city. Members of the Phoenix  are  well-trained gunmen with shooting ranges spread throughout the city in which they train. They do not often involve themselves in wars with other gangs as they are the sole provider for most of them, but they also will not hesitate to open fire to protect their wares or if they are being set up. The Phoenix is known to be one of the four largest gangs within Letum, yet remarkably also one of the gangs with the fewest members serving jail time or being out of the running for any other reason. Their weapons are of high quality and used by every other gang in town, but the loyalty within the gang is low: many members prefer to be elsewhere. 714 members.<br><br><br> THE LILLITH GANG<br><br>Lillith is the oldest gang, founded in 1946 just after the second world war. They are named after their founder, Lily Thorn, who used Lillith as her nickname. They’re a gang of controversy. Lillith is the life of the party, as number one importer of drugs and owner of the most illegal breweries they’re the place to get all you need for a good party, but they often disagree on their prices, rules, politics or methods and tend to fall into gang wars with themselves as they are easily pissed off and seem to draw their guns to just about anything. On the other hand, they claim to be about peace in the streets and fight for the common good. They’re still one of the four biggest gangs, but only just, as their disloyalty ratings are high along with the number of members in jail. Most of their drugs are being sold by whores from the Red Lotus, as well as most of the Red Lotus whores are being used by Lillith Members. 495 members</p>

<table><tr class="ranks"><th>RANK</th><th>EXPLANATION</th></tr><tr class="ranks"><td class="rank">LEADER</td><td class="ranks">Every gang has different opinions on leadership. The Red Lotus knows two leaders and whenever either quits for whatever reason, a replacement will be picked by the remaining leader. The Back Dragons has a sole ruler chosen by democracy, for life, with the requirement that he or she is specialist in at least two different areas. The Phoenix democratically chooses a leader every five years, requiring a shooting-range accuracy of at least 80%. After the five years the leaders usually get a different, yet still high position within the gang. The Lillith requires an heir of the original Thorn family that started the gang.</td></tr><tr class="ranks"><td class="ranks">RUNNER UP</td><td class="ranks">A position known only within the Black Dragons. Having only one leader, they had to come up with a plan in case they had to cope with a sudden unexpected early departure (SUED, usually death.) This is one of the generals elected by the leader itself, who also runs the gang in times of need, for example if the leader ends up in jail, is out on a job or simply goes on holiday.</td></tr><tr class="ranks"><td class="ranks">GENERAL</td><td class="ranks">Both the Black Dragons and the Red Lotus know the position of generals, though in both guilds it’s slightly different. In the Red Lotus is a total of five generals, who in common day business seem equal in power to the two leaders. They have the same tasks (keeping the whores happy and the drugs good) but when it comes to decisions concerning, for example, wars, generals have barely anything to say, and the leader has the final word. In the Black Dragon there is a total of ten generals, among whom the rest of the members is equally divided in numbers of 120. They answer only to their superior, the leader. A general and the members below him are called a legion, and numbered in phonetic alphabet. (Ergo, the first general leads Legion Alpha, the second leads Legion Beta, etc.) The leader of the Black Dragons is free to order legions as pleases him or her, though in the field members will answer mostly to their general alone. (Exceptions happen). At every 120 members a new legion is created along with an extra position as general, until which the leader fulfills the general’s tasks over the remaining members.</td></tr><tr class="ranks"><td class="ranks">LIEUTENANT<br></td><td class="ranks">The Phoenix knows lieutenants. They are remotely alike the generals the Black Dragon uses, though there is only seven lieutenants, each assigned a specific area or task, and the leader also fulfills the position of one of the seven lieutenants.</td></tr><tr class="ranks"><td class="ranks">MASTER</td><td class="ranks">The Lillith knows two masters, the Master of Brewery, in charge of the illegal breweries and the products there of as well as the resale, and the Master of Drugs, in charge of the creation and import of the drugs as well as the resale. Other than these masters, the Lillith knows no ranks, only employees, known as regular members.</td></tr><tr class="ranks"><td class="ranks">LEGIONARY</td><td class="ranks">Alike the Black Dragons knows ten generals, each legion knows twelve legionaries. Legionaries perform the same tasks as generals but on a smaller scale, with only ten members. The legionaries and members are to proper function as if they do not, they will bring their entire legion in disregard.</td></tr><tr class="ranks"><td class="ranks">OFFICER</td><td class="ranks">The Red Lotus knows officers. Officers are in charge of a specific number of whorehouses and the logistics thereof, as well as they are responsible to reach the required amount of money from sales. They answer to the generals varying on the location they’re at.</td></tr><tr class="ranks"><td class="ranks">MEMBER</td><td class="ranks">The lowest rank in each gang is the members. After successfully getting through the trial period (which tests your loyalty, you have no rights but many obligations) you are added to the group of members. In the Black Dragons that means you fall under direct lead of the leader for the time being until you can be assigned a legion to be in. The leader will personally supervise your skills and training. In any of the other gangs the training is supervised by people lower in command, usually mere members.</td></tr></table>
