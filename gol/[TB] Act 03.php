<i>It was 4am when Gregory arrived back at the Sexy Stuns brothel. Even at this odd hour there was plenty of activity here; Sexy Stuns was the only 24/7 brothel in town, but as its owner Gregory could access the private areas, most of which were vacant at these hours, as well as he had his office in the basement.
His office was in the back of the basement and his footsteps echoed off the concrete walls as he walked through the hallways stacked with furniture. He could hear voices up ahead. Entering the office revealed that his wife Mia had decided to spend the night at his office with their son George, who was asleep on the couch. Mia had been talking with the Makaine sisters that usually ran the brothel in his absence.
Mia smiled gratefully at his return. She wasn’t as ecstatic as the Makaine girls were, but that made sense as Gregory had lied to her about the dangers of the mission. He had told her he was going to take care of one of his enemies, which was true, though he had failed to mention the girl he was going after was the most powerful person in the city. The Makaine girls had known the truth about the mission as they had to know what to do if Gregory would have never come back, and that was not something they wanted to do.
‘Did it work?’ asked Mia, slightly surprised and distrusting at the happiness of the others.
‘Yes,’ Gregory answered. ‘She will trouble us no more, resting eternally. Speaking of which, go get some rest yourself.’ Though his words seemed respectful, Mia realized it was a demand and she left the room, disappointed. Juine looked at the ground awkwardly in the silence that followed, Loja grabbed her phone. The girls were aware that Mia did not know what had gone on that night and they knew not to mention it if she was near. As the doors closed behind Mia, it was Gregory that broke the silence.
‘We should be prepared, with Megan out of the way but Thirza still out there the entire gang will know that I did it, as well as they will no doubt be funded to avenge their leader. And some of them are pretty decent fighters.’
‘Well be fine,’ said Juine with which she discarded the importance of the matter. ‘Did you find Emma?’
‘No,’ Gregory answered surprised at their interest in his daughter. ‘It was just Megan and her girlfriend in the house. They were in bed doing – well, God knows what. All I could see was Thirza’s head; she had Megan between her legs.’ Loja’s eyes grew wide.
‘What’s up with you?’ Juine asked her.
‘Eh, nothing,’ Loja replied. ‘I just thought you’d have the strength to face your enemies, Gregory.’
Gregory looked serious.
‘I couldn’t risk letting her get a second to defend herself, I feared she had a gun under the sheets rather than a dildo or something. I just shot the sheets a few times, saw the blood and knew she was dead.’ Loja got pale, mumbled something about a forgotten appointment and left the room in a hurry. Juine confused and left behind, went back to the main hall looking for her sister but she had vanished from sight. Gregory covered his son with a blanket and fell asleep in his chair, satisfied by what he had done.</i>

Tom managed to find his way through wires and machinery that took most of Joshi’s apartment. He found Joshi at the coffee table, among at least two dozens of external hard drives and a laptop with a smartphone connected to it. Joshi had given Tom a faint nod of recognition as he had entered the room, but other than that seemed more interested in what happened on his laptop. Unable to see the screen himself, Tom looked around awkwardly until he seemed to get more attention.
‘What’s up?’ asked Joshi.
‘Jay said you had Intel for me,’ Tom answered. It felt weird to address his crush merely with the first letter of her surname, but even though she had told him her name, she had also told him never to tell anybody else.
‘I do. Did she tell you what?’
‘We’re blowing up a boat, truck, or warehouse, right?’
‘Pretty much. Did you pick one yet?’
‘I figure the gunship is the best target. It’s refreshing and new, and I think imported weapons can harm us more than exported drugs or empty buildings.’
‘That makes sense, I suppose. The ships’ a feeder with a capacity of 300 twenty-foot equivalent units secured with twist-locks and lashing rods. They use a VHF radio device to contact the harbors and executives on land; the executives ask for a status update every hour, the harbor asks for details as soon as a ship shows up on their radar.’
‘I hate to interrupt you, Sandeep, but could you stick to the info I actually need to know to stop the boat?’ Joshi sighed.
‘Small container ship. You have a one hour window if you plan it right and make sure it keeps outside the harbor’s radar. Don’t wait for it to port, it will become too dangerous then and could potentially harm our cargo, other than that you’re pretty much free to do as you please but don’t leave traces. Jay’s orders. There’s wetsuits and oxygen tanks in the warehouse on Wallaby Road, the yacht keys are taped to the bottom of the desk in the office there. The ship doesn’t come in until tomorrow night so you have about a day to plan it, but make sure to run the plans by Jay first to see if she agrees.’
‘Thanks,’ Tom said. It was a lot of information to process.
‘Oh, one more thing. If you need any advice: Danilo was here earlier when I got the mail, he said he had a few ideas. Might be worth checking.'
‘Thanks again,’ Tom said. With great effort he managed to find his way back to the apartment’s entrance without knocking anything over and found himself back on the street in a matter of minutes.
