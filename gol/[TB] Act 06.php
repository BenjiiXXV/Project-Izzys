<i>Tom broke the connection. Jennifer looked at the clock and sighed. It was too early to get up, but now that she had an assignment she had very little choice. She took a quick shower and a light breakfast during which she posted a message on the Black Dragons forum only visible for the members she commanded. It asked of anybody available to be at her house, at twelve, armed and ready.
Jennifer lived close to the cathedral and could see its clock from her living room windows. As the clock hit twelve, eight of her members had arrived.
‘Alright listen up,’ Jennifer said as she got up. The cathedral’s bells were toiling loudly in the background. ‘Tonight I’m going out on sea with a few others for something classified, and we need stuff for that. We’re lucky, it’s all at the same place, but we’re also unlucky as the place we need to be is rather deep in Phoenix territory.’
‘That’s not too big a problem,’ replied one of her members, a girl called Stephanie. ‘We’re not at war with the Phoenix at the moment, are we?’
‘Technically, I’d agree with you. At the moment this warehouse could be guarded a bit more, however, as they’re having a ship importing weapons this week. They may think we’re up to no good to prevent that from happening.’ The members sniggered.
‘I guess that tells us what you’re doing tonight then?’ Stephanie mentioned. Jennifer answered the question merely with a smile, then drew her phone and moved on.
‘I’ve asked Legionist Sandeep to open up a VPN for us through which we can communicate using the voice messaging service within the Black Dragons application. We’ve been assigned channel eleven and the password is “wallaby” which is written without capitals. Sandeep has been so kind to offer assisting us from his home. He can see the location of everybody logged onto the channel and can direct us if needed or notify us if there’s a spy logging on.’ The members grabbed their phones too, plugged in their headsets and navigated to channel eleven on the Dragons’ VPN.
‘Welcome team Roe,’ said Joshi’s voice as soon as everybody had signed in.
‘Thanks Sandeep,’ answered Jennifer. They left the house and Jennifer led her team to the right district. She looked at her team.
Stephanie had a silencer on her handgun, as had Thomas, her brother. Martin walked with two knives knew Jennifer, Dylan and Paul had a machine guns on their shoulder. Laure carried a Magnum .45 revolver which could not be silenced. Ilja and Gerdriaan both dual wielded open-bolt, blowback-operated submachine guns. Jennifer carried knifes, handling them with such an expertise that most enemies never knew what got to them. She quickly made a plan.
‘There are probably snipers on the rooftops,’ she said. ‘So I’d suggest Stephanie and Thomas to go up on the roofs and get them down quietly. You can use their sniper rifles to get the ones across the street down.’ Thomas and Stephanie nodded and left the group to look for an emergency ladder.
‘Martin, Gerdriaan and Paul, head around the back and clear the street from the other side. If there’s no hostility, don’t make any. Ilja, Laure and Dylan, you will do the same from this end, with me.’ The others nodded too and while Martin, Gerdriaan and Paul left to get to the other side, Jennifer approached the corner on this side of the block with her team. She looked into the street, it seemed deserted.
 ‘Remember, guys, technically we’re not at war so don’t cause any casualties if there’s a way not to.’ She threw another look into the street and again noticed it to be completely empty. That was not a good sign.
‘Sandeep, who’s on duty inside the storage department?’
‘Legionist Haydon of the Janssen Legion,’ answered Joshi. ‘I’ve tried to contact him but he’s irresponsive.’
‘That’s bad news,’ Jennifer concluded. ‘Very bad news. Team, double time.’
‘Roofs are clear,’ Thomas said through the VPN.
‘Upper windows clear too,’ added Stephanie. ‘We’ll keep ‘m secure.’
‘We’re in position,’ said Paul. ‘Road seems clear, ready to move.’
‘Given recent intel I suspect more hostility inside the storage department than outside. Move at once on my mark. Stephanie, Thomas, be our eyes on the street as well and report any suspicious behavior.’
‘Roger that,’ replied several voices.
‘Ground teams, move in three… Two… One… Go, go, go!’
Both teams ran for the storage department, keeping low to the ground and covering each other’s back. There was nobody in sight, however, and both teams reached the place without firing a single bullet.
‘Alright, when we go in I want Ilja and Dylan to the left and Gerdriaan, Laure and Paul to the right. Martin, you and I will go mid, the guns giving us cover. Remember our Objective. The office should have name-tagged wetsuits for the Generals and Legionists which Martin and I will get. There are oxygen tanks on the left and right, if both the side teams could take 2 each that would be splendid. Sandeep, anything I’m forgetting?’
‘Seems you got things covered.’
‘Brilliant.’ Jennifer counted down and the teams entered the building but there were no Phoenix members inside. Instead, Legionist Haydon was on the ground, unconscious, but alive. He had severe injuries and was shot several times, but his life seemed to have been saved due to the bulletproof vest he was wearing.
‘Sandeep, I need an ambulance ASAP,’ said Jennifer. Martin had entered the main office and was looking for the wetsuits while the gun teams on the sides had found the oxygen tanks and brought them to the center of the hall, where Jennifer concerned herself with Legionist Haydon.
‘I’ll have one on route.’
‘Great, thanks. Martin, found the wetsuits?’
‘Yeah, I’m bringing them in.’
‘No, Martin, don’t,’ said Sandeep. ‘Duck, hide beneath the desk. Roe, get your team to cover. Thomas and Stephanie just went offline.’
‘You heard the man,’ said Jennifer. ‘Get to cover. This ain’t over yet.’
‘What’s-
‘Get to cover!’ The entrance doors burst open and Roe’s team found itself in a rain of bullets.</i>

Tom decided to get to New Hope Hospital just after one o’clock. He didn’t like sitting idly by while his team was doing all the work, and he figured that way at least he was doing something, if not for the assignment, then for the good of the gang. He called Valerius from the hospital’s parking lot.
‘Aetius, I-
‘Seventh floor, head right twice, fourth room on the left.’ Valerius broke the connection.
‘Rude,’ commented Tom with the phone still to his ear. He got out of the car and into the elevator. At the seventh floor he turned right twice and just as he found the right corridor, a series of doctors and nurses drove a hospital-bed with a young girl out of the fourth room on the left, followed by what probably was her mother and, at last, Valerius. Recognizing Tom, the mother hesitated.
‘Go on ahead, Carine, I’ll be there shortly,’ said Valerius. She threw a look of distrust and disagreement in his direction but listened never the less and let the two men alone.
‘What do you want, Tom?’ asked Valerius as soon as they were alone.
‘I was informed that Jay is dead, I was also told you know more about it.’
‘Who told you all that, that Valdez girl?’
‘Does it matter who gave me the Intel?’
‘Yes, it does. Not every source is reliable in every case. She was right about an assassination attempt on Megan that evening, but that doesn’t mean her perception of truth on the outcome of last night aligns with the facts.  I happen to know the Valdez’ source and that source is not reliable. Besides, I thought you didn’t trust the Valdez girl?’
‘I don’t, but her Intel on the murder plan seemed reliable.’
‘It’s remarkable that you think I killed Megan while you were told Gregory would commit the attempt. Listen, of course I know more, but I also know you don’t trust me and nothing I can tell you will make you change your mind about that. Why don’t you check it out for yourself? They’ve left the scene untouched, you can head for Megan’s house and check it out, or you can head for her office and see if she’s there. Or, you know, you could have a little more trust in the way she does business alike she has for the past couple of years and just carry on with your assignment. It’s up to you.’ Aetius turned around and headed for the elevators, leaving Tom behind in the corridor.
