<i>Valerius drove Mia to the Dragons’ headquarters. It was not conventional to bring outsiders to the main headquarters; usually appointments were made elsewhere but this was not a usual appointment.
‘Don’t talk to anyone but the people in the main office,’ Valerius told Mia. ‘And don’t make eye contact with anyone but the people you’re talking to. These people do not trust you, and they will want to harm you.’
‘Sounds like a warm welcome,’ Mia responded, but Valerius ignored her.
‘Follow me and stay close.’ Valerius and Mia got out of the car and entered the building. As anticipated, the people in the building looked up as they passed. Some threw insults in Mia’s direction as according to them she did not belong there but Mia ignored them and kept close to Valerius as they ascended the stairs to the office. The top of the stairs had nothing but the big wooden doors that allowed access into the office. The hallway wasn’t lit, nor had it windows, but Valerius knew where the door was and knocked. After Nicky responded, the two entered the office.
‘Miss Q., this is Mia Dermoni,’ Valerius announced.
‘Yeah, we had a brief encounter earlier.’ Nicky sat in Megan’s chair, of course, to which she had the full right as interim leader. It felt odd, however, to see somebody other than Megan occupying that chair and Valerius saw by Thirza’s body language that she agreed.
‘Why are you here, Miss Dermoni?’
‘Gregory took what meant most to me, so I will take what means most to him; his gang.’ A devilish smile played with her lips. ‘Well, you’ve come to the right place at the wrong time. As much as I’d like to have the downfall of The Red Lotus on my name, I’m not sure if I can afford launching such a project in the current state of affairs.’
‘The only reason that The Red Lotus stands so strong is because men like sex too much to attempt taking over. Truly, the leadership is eerily fragile.’
‘What are you suggesting?’
‘The Red Lotus always has two leaders. Gregory just lost his daughter – may God have mercy on her soul – so naturally the other leader, Malcolm Winter, will force him to step down as “a death in the family can negatively influence your judgment.” Naturally, with the “for the sake of the gang” cliché Gregory will agree, reluctantly. Most likely Malcolm will give him an empty promise like “When things go better you’ll be back.” Well, he’s in for a surprise. If we flash some cash we can probably get Malcolm to assign the co-leadership to who-ever we want. Malcolm always cared more for the cash than the gang, same reason he does most of the drugs-trades and stuff. He’s also the one in charge of all the financial paperwork, no doubt a lot of shady business happens there too, perhaps food for blackmail. One way or another, if you can get a Dragon to be assigned leader of the Lotus and then – one way or another – get Malcolm out too, it’ll be up to the remaining Lotus Leader, our Dragon in disguise, to assign a new leader. I think the rest of the plan is rather obvious, and the entire Red Lotus gang will be in the Dragon’s hands, which quite the possibilities to go with from there on.’
‘That actually sounds plausible,’ Nicky admitted.
‘I can swing by and flash some cash, that way it won’t show up on the register so nobody but the people in this room will be aware of the plan ergo nobody but the people in this room can thwart the plan. That means if something goes wrong, we know who to look for and therefore where to look.’ She threw a mean look in Mia’s direction which Mia noticed, but ignored.
‘I concur that it would be best not to withdraw from any monitored source, but sending you would have no use. Malcolm is a sexist man, convinced that women are no good for anything but providing food and satisfaction. If we send a female, we might as well send nobody at all.’
‘I can bribe him,’ Valerius said. ‘Hell, I can even take the leader spot, that way truly nobody out of this room will be aware of it.’
‘Very well,’ Nicky concluded. ‘Mia, we’ll stay in touch, you can take your leave.’ Nicky waited until Mia had left the room and closed the door before she continued discussing more private matters.</i>

Tom climbed the three sets of stairs loudly and banged on the office door which again opened at once, and again by Valerius.
‘Bankers,’ he said with a smile that Tom did not like at all. 
‘Aetius,’ Bankers answered coldly.
‘I heard you got demoted,’ Valerius mentioned.  ‘Sad business. I was just taking my leave.’ Valerius awaited no reply but slipped past Tom and vanished.  Tom entered the office and looked at Nicky in the chair. Nicky looked back, and they shared a cumbersome moment. The last time they had seen each other Nicky was wounded as she’d taken a hit during a mission assigned by him as he was in charge of her at the time. She had then carried on with the mission rather than to seek aid, and ha even endangered her health more for the sake of the job. She was still convinced he had betrayed her, but now the tide had turned and Nicky was in charge of Tom now. That realization spawned a smile on her face that discomforted Tom just as much as the smile on Valerius’ face had done.
‘Why are you here, Bankers?’ she asked. Any warmth she had emitted in their previous conversations had vanished. She had not forgiven him, and no longer had any reason to show him respect.
‘Listen, man, what happened on the boat was clearly a big misunderstanding and has gone terribly wrong. I’m sorry for what happened; I never meant to put any of you in mortal danger.’
‘Miss Jay insisted on taking care of you herself,’ Nicky said. ‘She though my actions could possibly be too severe, and she feared I would kill you.’ They looked at each other in silence. Tom knew that what she said was the truth and he figured it’d be right not to respond as he attempted to hide any signs of fear.
‘I don’t think she was wrong, and in all honesty I wouldn’t mind killing you. As long as you’re of use to me, however, I won’t have to.’
‘What do you want me to do?’
‘I just send an e-mail to the Valdez sisters with their new assignment. There’s been some suspicious behavior uptown near the hospital. I could tell from the files that Jay was planning to send a small team through the sewer system, entering from the hospital’s basement. Though I’m sorry for the Valdes sisters that I’m sending them into the sewerage, I also feel kind of sorry that I cannot join; I’d like watching you getting covered in shit.’
‘Where do I meet them?’ Tom asked. He did not at all look forward to entering the sewers, but given the current state of affairs he decided it would be best to keep following orders for now.
‘Karyme is at the cemetery, Estella is in the cathedral; meeting up with the both of them now is rather impossible. I suggest you meet them at the hospital around eighteen hundred hours. I’ll let them know.’
‘Anything else?’
‘Make sure your gun is silenced and bring nothing but your gun. I don’t want to see anything about explosives in the reports.’

<i>Tom left, Nicky and Thirza were now alone and able to discuss their strategies concerning The Red Lotus gang or the matters around the evermore imprisoned Megan Jay. They were thwarted, however, by the ringing of Thirza’s phone in her pocket. She took it out and looked at the screen, confused, as nobody other than Megan ever called her.
‘International call,’ Thirza said. Nicky shrugged.
‘Could be your parents,’ she answered.
‘Probably. That’s weird though, it’s been over a year since they left and they never call me. I wonder what they want.’ She accepted the call. ‘Thirza Seraph speaking.’
‘Thirza, this is your father,’ her father said. ‘I was looking at my online copy of The Letum Telegraph and I came across something rather disturbing; that girl we left you with is in jail.’
‘I know, father.  We’re taking care of it.’
‘Taking care of it? Listen, young lady, we left you with that girl because you said you were in good hands with her.’
‘And I stand by that point, nothing bad has happened to me since you moved away.’ Nicky gave her a sarcastic look, knowing she was lying.
‘That could just be luck. She’s in jail now, that can’t be a mistake.’
‘Actually, she got framed for a murder but she was the intended victim, not the murderer.’
‘Yes, that makes your situation sound a lot safer. I’ve done some research on that girl of yours, which I should’ve done a long time ago, and I found some pretty disturbing facts, Thirza.’
‘Surprise me.’
‘Well, let’s just say if a guy would show up with a job history as extensive as her criminal record I would make him chairman right away. That kid is dangerous, Thirza. I’m very tempted to send your brother to come and collect you.’
‘Really? Because I remember back when I was sixteen you made me choose between coming to America with the family or staying with the girl I love “forever and always with no turning back,” in your exact words.’
‘Clearly she has changed and clearly you mother and I were mistaken about her.’
‘With all due respect, father, but maybe you were mistaken about me. I still love Megan more than anything and I knew what she was involved with when I chose her over America. She’s been in this business since she was twelve, after all, and she’d been leading the biggest gang of the city for over a year when you let me pick between her and you. I don’t care what she does, father. Sure I get worried a lot and I fear for her life but she has made me feel happier than you with all your servants and your expensive education. I love her and there’s nothing you can do about that.’
‘I think you need to see a shrink for that Stockholm syndrome, Thirza.’
‘Stockholm syndrome? Did you really just call me to trash my choices, my life and my love? You left your sixteen years old daughter on her own in a corrupt city ran by criminals and don’t show any signs of life. Yeah, sure, your bank account automatically transfers a few thousand bucks each month without a message, without so much as a “we miss you” or a “wish you were here” or whatever, just because it’s your duty. Nah, nothing like that, after a year you just decide to call me up and talk bad about me and my friends.’
‘You’re right, I haven’t been a good father.’
‘And guess what: these people here actually like me. If you send John to collect me I won’t go kindly and the moment he tries to force me he’ll have more guns to his head than you’ve ever seen in your life. Do yourself a favor and don’t kill your son while trying to so heroically “save” me from a danger that isn’t even there. I know you don’t trust her anymore, but frankly I don’t give a damn.’
‘Watch your language, young lady.’
‘Or what, you’re gonna ground me?’ Her father did not respond. There was some kind of scuffle on the other end of the line.
‘Honeykins!’ Thirza’s mother yelled through the phone so loud that Nicky could hear it. She looked up with a teasing grin.
‘Mom, what’s up?’ Thirza said, throwing a semi-angry look in Nicky’s direction.
‘Oh, honeykins, I miss you so?’
‘Yeah, I noticed by the thousands of letters and emails and phone calls that I got over the past year.’
‘I meant to send stuff, hon. I really did. But your father said it would be best not to.’
‘How did he phrase that? “It’s better not to communicate with your youngest daughter who we left behind on her own because she wanted to stay and we can’t manage in America with less than a family of five?” You didn’t seem to care so much about what father thought when you were screwing around with the plumber. He was over a lot more often than we had clogged pipes, mom. Don’t think I was too young to know what went on.’
‘Honeykins, I don’t know what you’re talking about.’
‘I think you and father have some talking to do. Oh, and tell him I’m contacting the Letum Telegraph to revoke his membership. If he wants the outcome of the trial he’ll have to ask me. You know, the proper way parents show interest their children’s lives.’ Thirza hung up and sad down, agitated.
‘Honeykins, you alright?’ Nicky mockingly said. Thirza did not laugh.
‘Oh, shut up,’ she answered. ‘We’ve got work to do.’ 

It was early in the morning as Megan entered the visitors’ room once again with her lukewarm coffee. She walked up to the same booth as last time, though it was only Nicky on the other side this time. She looked as though she had cried.
‘Meg, I fucked up,’ she said as soon as Megan had put the receiver to her ear.
‘Whatcha mean you fucked up?’
‘I’m not a leader, Megan. It’s been two days and I already fucked up.’
‘What happened?’
‘I send a team to explore through the sewerage beneath the hospital; the Valdez sisters and Bankers.’
‘I know. I made those plans. What happened?’
‘Estella’s dead, Karyme’s in the ICU. We found them together behind the hospital in a dumpster. Karyme’s in comatose. Tom’s MIA.’ Megan looked at Nicky in disbelief; exploration never went wrong like that. Sure, sometimes people took a bullet or a knife, but usually nobody died.
‘Don’t blame yourself,’ Megan told Nicky. ‘Nobody blames you for what happened, and neither should you. People die during assignments because what we do isn’t without danger. People will always die, whether you are in charge or I am doesn’t matter. People die. If I hadn’t been in here things would not have gone any different.’ Though it were empty words, they seemed to improve Nicky’s mood, and a faint smile appeared on her face.
‘Hey, remember that girl that saw the ambush happen?’
‘The Lillith ambush? Yeah, I remember her. What about her?’
‘She was put in witness protection to testify against the few Lillith members that they arrested. Naturally the folks from witness protection fucked up again and her parents got killed.’
‘So what?’
‘Check this out.’ Nicky took the letter from mister Blythe out of her pocket, unfolded it and held it against the glass for Megan to read.
‘Heh,’ Megan said as she finished reading. ‘That was unexpected. So now what?’
‘I don’t know what to do, man. I can’t take care of that kid.’
‘Why not? I take care of Daisy, why wouldn’t you be able to take care of Layla?’
‘I’m not good when it comes to safeguarding others, you know that. Can’t I put her in the monastery?’
‘No, I won’t allow that. You’re not alone in this, though. Where’s she now?’ 
‘With Daisylisa and Thirza, at your house.’
‘I rest my case, you’ll do fine. Thirza and I are here for you.’</i>
