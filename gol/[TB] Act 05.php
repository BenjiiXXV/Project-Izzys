Tom had been sitting in the car for ten full minutes with his phone in his hands, gazing at the screen that had turned black. Valerius Aetius knew more about how and where Megan was, so that was worth checking out. However, he didn’t believe Megan was truly dead and she knew how to survive. Contacting her directly or discussing it with Valerius on the phone could be dangerous to all three of them, and Tom had his mission to focus on; even if Megan was dead, another shipment of guns in the hands of the Phoenix would do nobody good. If he was going to meet with Valerius, he had to make sure his team would be able to prepare everything needed to blow the ship up.
He scrolled down his contacts list until he found Nicky’s number, he would call her first. The phone was picked up right away.
‘I’ve been expecting your call,’ Nicky said. She seemed to be at a busy place, and Tom could tell she used her headphones for hands-free calling. He knew she preferred this, because it meant her hands were free in case of an unforeseen attack or ambush.
‘Good morning to you too,’ Tom answered.
‘Yeah, morning General. What do you need?’
‘The yacht was stolen, and we need it tonight.’ Nicky laughed shortly.
‘Say no more. When and where do you need it?’
‘Twenty hundred hours, pier nineteen.’
‘Consider it done, sir.’ Nicky closed the connection. Tom smiled, if only all his Legionists were this reliable. He scrolled back up his list until he found Jennifer, who took her time before picking up.
‘Jennifer,’ she said as she picked up. There were no background sounds, and Tom assumed she was at home.
‘Good morning Miss Roe. Did Seuss inform you about the mission?’
‘No, sir. He said you would.’
‘Very well, I’ll stick to what you need to know now. I need wetsuits, three of them, with oxygen masks and tanks and all that. The complete set.’
‘Alright, any specific sizes?’
‘You, Seuss and Q will be the one’s using them. I think that’s enough of a hint. If you come across one in my size, feel free to bring it along. Oh, also: to the bottom of the desk should be taped a key. I doubt we’ll still need that, but bring that along just to be sure. The warehouse is on Wallaby Road.’
‘Wallaby Road? That’s Phoenix territory!’
‘It’s our warehouse, though. There should be little hostility, but I suggest bringing your people along anyway.’ Jennifer sighed.
‘Consider it done, General Bankers. Where do we meet afterwards?’
‘The harbor, at twenty hundred hours, pier nineteen.’ Tom broke the connection and dialed Valerius.
‘What do you want?’ Valerius asked agitated. He did not enjoy being disturbed. 
‘It’s me, Bankers,’ Tom replied.
‘I can read a phone’s screen. What do you want?’
‘I heard you know more about Jay, I think we need to talk.’
‘That sounds threatening. What did you have in mind?’
‘I’m swinging by the headquarters later, do you have time?’
‘Headquarters, funny.’ Valerius sniggered. ‘I’ll meet with you on the condition we do it in an NWZ. I’m at New Hope most of the afternoon. Swing by if you can’t hold yourself.’
‘I rather insist on meeting at the headquarters, Aetius,’ said Tom demanding.
‘I don’t benefit from us meeting up; if you want to speak with me you’ll have to come to me. I know what you’re on about though, and a little more faith wouldn’t harm you.’ Valerius hung up. Not a second later, Tom’s phone rang. It was Joshi Sandeep.
‘General Bankers,’ Tom announced.
‘Hey,’ Joshi merely replied. ‘I know I’m not officially on this case, but I’ve done some research on the feeder you’re rigging and it seems to be a lot easier than I thought. The vessel’s basically rigged itself because it’s old and unmaintained which means the engine room is just a bomb without detonator. If you block the air vents that cool the engine, it should blow up when they start the diesel engines to move into port the whole thing will just blow itself up. Just leave some explosive material there for the extra bonus but you don’t have to make much, which I told Seuss as well. Looks like you’re having the day off until eight tonight, unless you had other plans. 
‘Thanks for the info. You said you discussed this with Seuss too?’
‘Yep, he’s all up to date.’
‘Good news, thanks Sandeep.’
‘No problem.’

<i>‘Consider it done, sir.’ Nicky closed the connection by pressing the button on her microphone. She pressed the button again, the microphone activated and the phone waited for instructions.
‘Phone, dial Sandeep,’ she said as she let go of the wires and scanned the area for suspicious behavior.
‘Dialing Sandeep,’ the phone confirmed. Seconds later she heard the dialing beeps, the ring beeps, and at last Joshi’s voice.
‘Hey Nicky,’ he said. She smiled, Joshi’s voice had a kindness in it that always made her smile with its lack of bitterness. Perhaps it was because he mostly functioned behind the screens. Sure, he was called into missions often enough but only for questions through the phone. He wasn’t a man in the field, his life was never in danger and he had never seen anybody die. She liked that innocence within him.
‘Hey Joshi,’ she replied. ‘I had Bankers call me and ask me to fetch the stolen yacht, any ideas on where it is?’
‘Of course, hang on.’ Nicky could hear Joshi typing and waited patiently, drawing a bottle of soda from a vending machine.
‘Found it,’ Joshi said not much later. ‘Looks like the Lotus took it; it’s docked to one of the quays near their tickets office for the water rides.’
‘The Lotus does water rides now?’
‘Double the pleasure at once the price. It’s a rather new idea they got, perhaps they still need boats.’
‘Ah, gross.’
‘Where are you now? I’ll send the route to your GPS.’
‘Bus station.’
‘It’s a short walk from there. Coordinates are being sent.’
‘Thanks Joshi, I owe you one.’
‘Just- don’t die or anything.’ Nicky closed the connection and left the bus station following the directions her phone told her. Joshi had been right, it was a short walk, and Nicky found herself at the right spot within five minutes. The yacht, a big, shiny, white weekender yacht called ‘The Little Seraph.’ Nicky knew it wasn’t by far the biggest yacht the Dragons had in their possession, nor the most expensive, and wondered why Tom had been so keen on getting this specific yacht back. She assumed it have something to do with its maneuverability and speed. 
The yacht was docked in front of a building carrying the Red Lotus emblem. It had red neon lights coming through the windows and two big guys in black suits played bodyguard. Below the emblem stood “Adult Boat Rides” with the subtitle “Double the Pleasure At Once the Price.” 
Nicky approached the lot casually, giving the impression that she was a casual trespasser. She didn’t take her eyes of the bodyguards, however, even though they seemed to have very little interest in her. As she reached The Little Seraph, she held back to pretend to admire it.
‘That’s a mighty nice boat,’ she said ecstatically as she grabbed the railing with both hands and climbed aboard. The guards, however, didn’t even seem to have noticed her. She glanced at them once more and then disappeared below deck.
The set-up below deck was rather simple. Right behind the door was a small, open kitchen on the left and a tiny bathroom on the right. A little further up ahead a bed was built in taking up most of the space and in this case most of Nicky’s attention, as there were two people having sex, unaware of her presence. She watched for a few seconds amazed by how little love the two showed. After the scene detested her, she made the couple aware of her presence.
‘Might I ask what you are doing on my yacht?’ The shock on the two faces was priceless. The man tried to hide his privates but the woman made no effort to. She got out of the bed instead.
‘I think you’re at the wrong yacht, this yacht belongs to the Red Lotus.’
‘Wrong. This is The Little Seraph, owned by the Black Dragons who I am sure had not these intentions for it. You can leave now or I’ll have you leave one way or another.’ The man grabbed his clothes right away and ran off, mumbling something about his wife, but the whore didn’t move. Determined, Nicky drew a model 42 Balisong from the inside of her jacket, it served its purpose. The woman looked shocked, apologized and left the cabin naked, closely followed by Nicky who would detach the boat from the quay.
The guard hadn’t noticed Nicky entering the boat. They hadn’t noticed the half-dressed man leaving the boat in a hurry and they even failed to notice the naked woman passing them as she headed back into the building. They ignored how Nicky detached the boat from the quay, but they woke up when she jump-started the engine.
‘Hey!’ they said as they left their post and climbed aboard the ship. In her turn, Nicky ignored the guards as she turned the wheel and accelerated through the canal. She knew it wouldn’t have any curves or corners and head for sea in one go. The men were big and had effort climbing up the tiny ladder to the bridge which gave Nicky just enough time to adjust the course properly before she had to dodge an incoming attack. She rolled over and blocked a fist with her lower arm while her other elbow hit the second guy in his stomach. He stumbled backwards and fell over the edge to the lower deck where he landed on his head which knocked him out. One less guy to worry about. The remaining guy grabbed her wrist and took her knife. With her free hand Nicky hit him on the nose, hard, and in a blind attack with her knife the man stabbed Nicky’s shoulder and let go of the knife. He stumbled backwards, holding himself up to the railing. Passing the speed lever Nicky slowed the boat down as they were out of the Lotus’ reach. She hit the man again, to his jaw, and kicked his knee. A faint crack told her she’d broken his kneecap and he attempted to cry in pain but only spat out blood and teeth. She hit him once more, her fist pounded hard onto his temple, and the man tumbled overboard.
She descended to the lower deck where the second man was coming to. She jumped onto his chest, sat down, and closed her hands around his neck.
‘I think you picked the wrong gang,’ she mentioned as he struggled her firm grip. ‘As well as the wrong girl to fight,’ she added. His attempts to resist grew more and more futile and vain until he dropped his head. With great effort Nicky managed to drag this man overboard as well.
She climbed back to the bridge, sat down in the wheelman’s chair and accelerated. Only then did she feel the piercing pain of her knife which was still dangling from her shoulder so she pulled it out and set sail for pier nineteen.</i>
