ACT EIGHT: MARE NOSTRUM (PART ONE)

It was almost eight as Tom drove onto pier 19 with his Alfa Romeo. He could see The Little Seraph docked in, which meant Nicky had gotten her part done. There was a green Seat parked next to it. He parked his car too and boarded the ship, to find Nicky and Jennifer sunbathing on the front deck in the last rays of sunshine. Tom noticed blood on Nicky’s clothes and through a hole in her shirt he could tell her shoulder was bandaged, but she paid no further attention to it.
‘Who owns the green Seat?’ Tom asked, pointing with it with his thumb over his shoulder.
‘I’m not sure,’ answered Jennifer. ‘But Sandeep said I could use it. I’ll bring it back though, promise.’ Tom wasn’t convinced, but chose to ignore it. He entered the ship and checked the kitchen. There was a pot of coffee on the counter, three six-packs coke in the fridge and a box of cookies in one of the cabinets. The silverware drawer had two boxes of condoms among the silverware for some weird reason. He grabbed the cookies and a coke and went back outside. As he did so, Danilo made his way onto the ship and a cab drove off into the city after having dropped him off. Danilo carried a weekend bag, most likely with the explosives. He carefully put the bag in a corned after which he shortly embraced Nicky, kissed Jennifer and shook hands with Tom.
‘I prepared some stuff,’ he said as he threw a look at the weekend bag. ‘Also I got us an alibi to not raise any suspicion for when we enter the ship’s radar, so I’ll be at the radio.’ He climbed the ladder to the bridge followed by Nicky, who mumbled something about taking the rudder. Moment later, the yacht’s engines roared to life. Jennifer and Tom detached the ship from the pier and they sailed off to open sea.
‘Alright I think I’ll go onto the ship with Q. and Roe,’ said Tom as the crew met on the bridge.
‘No way,’ said Danilo. ‘I’m not letting Jenny on that ship without me.’ Tom looked at him in silence for a while before he responded.
‘Fine,’ he said at last. ‘Seuss, you go in my place. It will take us about an hour longer to get onto their radar and within reach so I suggest the three of you go and put on the wetsuits.’ Tom took the rudder as the other three headed downstairs into the cabin to change. A good fifteen minutes later he heard the clunks of oxygen tanks against the wood that covered the rear deck, as well as the sound of the white, small, watertight barrels with the red top being prepared. It were the girls that prepared them, apparently, as Danilo was already back on the bridge.
‘These things are tight and uncomfy,’ he complained.
‘Don’t look at me, Seuss, you chose for this,’ Tom replied. At that point the girls came back up to the bridge as well. As Tom let Nicky back behind the rudder he couldn’t help himself but to admire her curves and he tried his hardest to not look at Jennifer at all, knowing that as Danilo was her boyfriend, he would not appreciate it. He realized it had been a smart move of Danilo to go to the ship with the girls, he’d get to see them both wet.

‘Alright,’ Danilo said ages later. ‘We’re about to enter their radar. They’ll be suspicious about any ship entering their radar as they’re carrying illegal goods, so let me do the talking.’ No sooner had he finished speaking or a voice came out of the intercom.
‘Attention vessel, this is the MV Jericho, please state your business.’ Danilo smiled like a young boy in a toys store as he answered the ship.
‘Evening Jericho, this is the MY Little Seraph, Navy patrol in service. We’ve gotten some notices about potential piracy in the area, be advised.’
‘Copy that, Little Seraph, we’ll report unusual behavior.’
‘Appreciate it. What’s your cargo, Jericho?’
‘X-marked containers, no questions asked.’
‘Roger that.’
‘That’s sad,’ mentioned Jennifer. ‘They’re all gonna die and don’t even know why.’
‘They’re lying,’ Danilo said. ‘They know damn well what they’re carrying.’
‘Alright, listen up,’ said Tom. He dropped the anchor; the on-board computer read it had found ground at a depth of fifteen meter. That meant the feeder could barely sail here at all. ‘The plan is simple. You three go in, blow up the cargo containers at the front of the ship and get the hell out of there.’ He had great effort to keep looking at the faces rather than to have his eyes drop when addressing the girls. He caught himself glancing at Nicky’s breast only twice, however, which he considered an achievement.
‘What? That’s not the plan Sandeep suggested,’ protested Danilo.
‘Well Sandeep isn’t here is he? This is the plan I give you, this is the plan you execute. Alike the Jericho said, no questions asked. Now can you get into the water on your own or do I need to throw you in?’
Reluctantly the team ascended to the lower deck, put on their oxygen tanks, grabbed the watertight barrels and quietly got into the water. After all, water carried noises far, they knew, especially at night.

<i>They swam underwater to make sure they would go unnoticed, and signaled each other as they had no other means of communication. The water was bright, however, and the moonlight shone through enabling them from seeing each other rather well. It took the team about twenty minutes to get near The Jericho. They swam around the ship looking for the anchor chain which they found on the front of the ship. Danilo climbed the chain and attached a rope to the railing, then switched to the rope and climbed aboard the ship. The girls used the rope to get onto the ship as well after which they detached the ropes and erased their traces. In the dark they made their way to the back of the ship, where they would be concealed by the shadows and out of sight of the bridge.
‘So that’s it then,’ Jennifer whispered as Nicky drew her phone from one of their barrels. ‘We’re supposed to just blow up the ship and go down with it, that’s his plan?’
‘That’s his plan,’ replied Nicky darkly. ‘But I’ve never really been one to just go with the plan. Sounds to me like he’s trying to get rid of us. I’m gonna give Sandeep a call, stay on the lookout.’
Danilo headed a few feet to the middle of the ship, staying behind a stack of crates as cover. Jennifer set her back against the metal wall and peered around the corner. There was a light up ahead, which enabled her to see anybody coming in. Nicky made herself smaller, even though she wasn’t too big to begin with, and dialed Joshi’s phone.
‘Hey Nicky,’ said Joshi as he picked up the phone. Unnoticed by the others Nicky smiled again at the sound of his voice and the lack of bitterness within. It made her feel warm.
‘Hey Joshi,’ Nicky replied as serious as she could. ‘We’re having a bit of trouble following Bankers’ plan so we’re gonna need you to walk us through your plan again.’
‘A little insubmission, I see. What materials did you bring?’ Nicky looked into the barrel.
‘Looks like we got three RPG-43 anti-tank grenades and extra rounds for handguns.’
‘Blowing up a ship and surviving it when all you got are Russian anti-tank grenades? A challenge, I like it. What’s the engine room look like?’
‘I don’t know; we’re still on the deck. We’ll move in and I’ll call you back.’
‘Be safe, Nicky.’ Nicky broke the connection and reassembled the group while Joshi would do some brainstorming on how to get the job done. The trio managed to get to the door unseen. Most people appeared to be asleep, and the two men that were supposed to keep watch seemed to have dozed off on the bridge as the night seemed eventless and boring.
There was a small set of steps leading down which they descended. At the bottom was a large door with a sign saying ‘ER.’ They opened the doors and descended another set of steps leading them into the noisy engine room. Nicky did a quick round to explore the room, then got herself to the quietest corner and re-dialed Joshi.
‘Hey Nicky,’ said Joshi once again. Nicky smiled, which Jennifer noticed.
‘I got eight separate engines,’ Nicky yelled into the phone she barely got over the sound of the engines. ‘There’s two in use.’
‘Don’t mess with the two in use, they’re providing the electricity all that for the ship. If you mess with those they’ll notice right away. We need something that can’t be monitored as an error before it’s too late, because they’ll be checking the engines statuses on the screens at the bridge. Can you see some kind of v belt like cars have?’ 
‘Yeah, looks like they all got one.’
‘You’re gonna need some kind of rope to tie the ring of the grenade’s pin to that belt. Make sure you secure the grenade, and then when they start the engines the belt will pull the pin out of the grenade and the whole thing goes boom.’
‘Belt, rope, pin, boom. Got it. Thanks Joshi.’
‘No problem. Be safe!’
‘Alright,’ said Nicky after hanging up the phone. She grabbed a grenade and showed it to the group. ‘We’re gonna rig three of the engines by attaching the pin’s ring to the engine’s belt. After that we get the hell off this ship and hope it works. The grenades are anti-tank so they’re bound to give a good punch and these engines run on diesel so if Bankers is watching – which I’m sure he will – he’ll be given a nice show.’
‘Sounds solid,’ said Jennifer sarcastically. Danilo grinned.
‘How are we gonna attach the rings to the belts?’ he asked.
‘We’ll need some kind of rope,’ answered Jennifer. ‘I checked the barrel, it hasn’t got any.’ Her remark was followed by silence, as far as an engine room can be silent. 
‘Roe, unzip my wetsuit,’ Nicky suddenly said.
‘Honestly Nicky, I don’t think now’s the right time to initiate a striptease,’ Jennifer replied.
‘I won’t mind,’ admitted Danilo honestly, earning him a furious look from his girlfriend Jennifer.
‘No,’ Nicky continued, ignoring Danilo. ‘My shoulder’s got that bandage, we can use that.’
‘Don’t you need that to not bleed to death?’ Danilo asked as Jennifer started to unzip Nicky’s wetsuit. Danilo had the decency to look away, though probably only because otherwise Jennifer would kill him.
‘I can make it to the shore without; the wetsuit is tight enough to not have anything go anywhere.’
‘That sounds disgusting.’
‘It is, really.’ Nicky grimaced as Jennifer tore the bandage off the flesh. She dropped the bandage and helped Nicky get her wetsuit back on, which made Nicky grimace again. Nicky picked up the bandage, stained with blood and now filthy with oil or grease as well, and cut it into three pieces with her teeth.
‘That’s gross,’ she said as she gave Jennifer and Danilo a piece of bandage each. They each simultaneously tied one end of their bandage to the ring of the grenade’s pin, then walked up to an engine and tied the other end of the bandage to the engine’s belt and then jammed the grenade somewhere it would stay put when the engines would roar to life. They were gathering their stuff when Nicky’s phone rang. The screen read it was Valerius. Nicky picked up, much to dislike of the other group members. They were back at the front of the ship, at that moment, and were about to make their way back into the water. They were out in the open and in plain sight, if anybody on the bridge would bother to pay attention, they’d be caught.
‘Keep it short,’ said Nicky rudely.
‘Q, don’t go for The Little Seraph. I got wind of the betrayal. I’m not sure about Banker’s intentions, but I do know we’re better off not trusting him. If he did want you dead and you show up on his boat alive nothing will stop him from killing you like he killed before. I got a ship of mine anchored within your radar. Follow the line of the Jericho to the back, and keep going till you find a yacht called The Avalon Affinity. Find that, and you’ll find me. Find me, and you’ll find your safe way out of there.’ Valerius hung up before Nicky could answer.
‘Change of plans,’ Nicky told the others as she climbed across the barrier and headed for the anchor chain.
‘Follow me.’</i>
