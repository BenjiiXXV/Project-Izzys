Despite the court hall victory, the atmosphere at the Aetius estate could not be described as festive. Given the continuing absence of Tom Bankers and the situation with the Wither, there wasn’t much time to celebrate. They had barely been at the mansion for five minutes or Megan had already switched back into her usual, intimidating outfit and was pocketing her knives and guns as she walked back out of the bedroom.
‘I need to borrow your car,’ she told Valerius, who was already throwing his keys in her direction.
‘I know,’ he answered as the both of them ignored the looks of confusion on the faces around. Megan caught the keys and put them in her pocket right when Layla and Daisylisa appeared from one of the hallways. They briefly hugged their sisters upon passing and ran off again, well aware they weren’t wanted around gang related business. The atmosphere was tense.
‘Where are you going?’ Thirza asked, slightly annoyed. She’d hoped for some celebratory sex after four weeks of separation.
‘There’s a snitch,’ Megan answered, moving towards a staircase that would bring her to the underground garage. Thirza and Nicky followed while Valerius went outside with the other girls.
‘We’re gonna find the snitch,’ she continued. ‘Then we’re gonna hurt the snitch, find out who he snitches to.’
‘Then what?’ Thirza replied, as if it wasn’t obvious. ‘And who’s we? You don’t want me involved, usually.’
‘And I still don’t,’ Megan acknowledged. The trio had reached the garage and Megan used one of the keys to open up a locker filled with guns. She grabbed a shotgun and threw it towards Nicky. She caught it with ease and threw it into the trunk of a black Bugatti.
‘I’m the we,’ Nicky specified while catching an assault rifle and stashing it with the shotgun. She then got into the passenger’s seat and grabbed her phone. Megan tossed a sniper rifle in with the other guns and added a duffle bag with ammunition before giving Thirza a kiss.
‘What do you need all these guns for?’ she asked.
‘If you're going to try, go all the way,’ Megan said with a smile. ‘Otherwise, don’t even start. Charles Bukowski.’ She closed the trunk and grabbed Thirza’s ass, pulling her close and giving her another kiss.
‘You stay here and guard the fort,’ Megan said. ‘I’ll be back before you know it.’ After that she got in the driver’s seat of the Bugatti and started the engine, looking at Nicky.
‘Are you ready to boop some booty?’ Megan said. Nicky laughed.
‘Don’t ever say that again,’ she answered, half out of breath, while Megan slowly drove out of the garage. 

They were nearing the city center when Megan’s phone rang. She handed it to Nicky.
‘Answer it,’ Megan told her. ‘Put it on speaker.’ Nicky did as she was asked.
‘This is J. and Q., you’re on speaker,’ Megan announced.
‘Hey Megan, Nicky,’ Joshi said. Nicky tried to hide her smile. ‘Thirza said you’re after a snitch,’ he added. It wasn’t a question.
‘Yep,’ Megan merely answered.
‘Do you know who it is?’ Joshi asked.
‘Yep,’ Megan again answered.
‘Is it Tom?’
‘Yep,’ Megan once more answered.
‘Want his location?’ he asked.
‘Do you have it?’ Megan replied, slightly surprised.
‘Yes,’ Joshi admitted. ‘I’ve had it all along, really, but Nicky told me to keep it a secret until you’d be back. She said you’d have something in mind for him.’ Megan looked at Nicky, who blushed slightly.
‘Thanks,’ she told the both of them. ‘It means a lot to me,’ she added. Nicky smiled faintly. 
‘So where’s he at, Joshi?’ Nicky asked.
‘Megan’s house, he’s been holding up there for the past month.’ A devious smile appeared on Megan’s face.
‘I guess my bedroom is going to be a crime scene, again.’

It took the duo barely half an hour to cross the rest of the city to the suburban hood were Megan’s house was. It was the only gang-owned property in the hood – courtesy of Thirza’s family, which was why none of the gangs had noticed Tom’s car on the driveway. They never came out this way, this far. Megan dimmed the lights as soon as they entered her street and quietly parked the car a few houses away from her own. Megan noticed the lights in the master’s bedroom – her bedroom – were on, but she couldn’t see Tom’s silhouette in the window so he didn’t appear to be watching the road. She guessed he figured if no one had bothered to check for him here, they weren’t going to anymore either.
‘So what’s your plan?’ Nicky asked, looking at the house.
‘Push the car onto the road - blow it up - go into the house - torture him - torture him some more - then maybe some more, I’m not sure yet – then kill him,’ Megan answered.
‘He deserves to suffer, death isn’t suffering,’ Nicky replied.
‘I agree,’ Megan agreed. ‘But if we leave him alive he might become a bigger problem. After I’m done with him he won’t be a dragon anymore and then who knows what he’ll do.’
‘Fair enough,’ Nicky realized. They both got out of the car and opened the trunk. Nicky grabbed the rifle and used the scope to keep an eye on the house while Megan went through the duffle bag. She sighed.
‘I’m not sure if we have enough to safely and subtly blow up a car,’ she said.
‘Don’t have enough? We have fucking loads, we just don’t have the right stuff.’
‘Yeah, whatever. It’s all the same.’
‘Maybe not,’ Nicky said. She put the rifle down and redialed Joshi. After a few seconds she smiled, and blushed slightly again when she noticed Megan had seen.
‘Hey Joshi,’ she said.
‘Hey Nicky, what’s up?’
‘We need another makeshift delayed detonator...’
