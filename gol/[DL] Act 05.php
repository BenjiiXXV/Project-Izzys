ACT FIVE: WITHERED TEA

Megan graciously rolled out of the still driving Bugatti as soon as Nicky passed the ER entrance with it. Valerius had been awaiting her; he opened the door as soon as Megan approached and set off through the hospital wing in a quickened pace.
‘What happened?’ Megan asked, following him with ease.
‘She went after you anyway,’ Valerius answered without looking at her. He seemed to know where he was going, but nevertheless all the hallways looked alike and it required some attention. The other people in the hospital jumped out of the way as the duo approached. Intimidating and angry they marched through the hallways until they reached the room Thirza was in.
Thirza wasn’t conscious. She was hooked to an IV monitor and had several strong painkillers slowly seeping into her, as well as she was bandaged on most of her torso and arms. There were clear stains of blood on the white bandage, as well as some of the blood seemed to be coming out from under them.
‘What else happened?’ Megan specified.
‘We’re not sure,’ Valerius answered. ‘I got a call from Carine, she saw Thirza being brought in when she went to visit our daughter.’
Megan said down in a chair next to the bed and sighed.
‘Well, how is your daughter?’ she asked, though she kept her eyes fixed at Thirza.
‘Fucked up,’ Valerius answered. He leaned against the wall and pulled his hand through his hair. 
‘I don’t know if I can take much more of this,’ he admitted. ‘My kid is a lot stronger than I am, apparently.’
‘Well your kid only has her own life to worry about,’ Megan defended. ‘You’ve got a whole lot more on your head. Val, if you need some time off, I-‘
‘Fuck that,’ Valerius interrupted. ‘The day I take time off is the day I die, and I won’t hear another word about it.’ He moved towards the door.
‘Where are you going?’ Megan asked.
‘I’m getting you coffee,’ he responded without looking back at her. She rested her elbows on her knees and dropped her head in her hands, rubbing her forehead.

Valerius returned not much later, followed by both Nicky and Joshi. They had concerned looks on their faces.
‘Joshi,’ Megan said with surprise. ‘It’s been a while since I saw you outside your house.’
‘Well my computer screens feel a lot safer,’ he admitted. ‘But when I called your phone I got Nicky who was at the reception and not sure where to go, so I came over.’ Megan checked her cellphone and noticed it had no bars. She put it back in her pocket.
‘Why did you need to reach me?’ she asked. Joshi, who also had his phone out, handed it to her. It had a video of an empty junction somewhere in town.
‘What am I looking at?’ she asked.
‘Keep watching,’ Joshi told her. A few seconds later she saw a car stop in front of a red traffic light. She recognized the blonde hair; it could only be Thirza. As the light turned green Thirza accelerated, only to slam her brakes as a dark red van raced onto the junction and blocked her way. It stopped in front of her and the side door opened on the camera’s blind side. Seconds later the screen flashed a dozen times as the windshield of the car Thirza drove was shattered, and her body shook. Then the van drove off as Thirza slid down in her seat slightly and dropped her head to the side.
‘Do you have another angle?’ Megan asked, trying not to let the choked up feeling in her throat control her voice. Nicky had gone pale, but Valerius seemed unmoved.
‘No,’ Joshi responded. ‘The other cams got damaged in a street shooting two days ago, they haven’t been fixed yet.’
‘Could you make out the plate?’ she asked him.
‘No need,’ Valerius interfered. ‘That’s an old Red Lotus van, it doesn’t carry the Dragons’ emblem.’
‘Wither,’ Megan realized. Valerius nodded. 
‘And I recognized the driver,’ he added. ‘It was Juine Makaine.’
‘That’s about to be one very dead Makaine,’ Megan said.
‘Should I bring the guns?’ Nicky asked.
‘Fuck no,’ Megan said. ‘I want this one to hurt. A lot.’
