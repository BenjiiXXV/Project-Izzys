Megan was brought into the courtroom flanked by two guards and her hands cuffed behind her back. She was still wearing an orange jumpsuit and her hair was still in a tight ponytail, but she seemed to have lost weight and her eyes looked weary. The courtroom was fuller than it usually was during a trial for murder as it was a common trial in Letum. Megan was put on the right side of the court room and released from her handcuffs. On the row behind her sat interim leader Nicky together with Thirza and half of The Dragons’ Generals. The second half of the generals sat on the second row, the rest of the courtroom’s right half was filled up with Legionists that had shown interest in the case. Valerius and Rose came in together and did not sit down, but stayed in the back instead. The left side of the room was filled with enemies of the Dragons including Gregory and his co-leader and many other Lotus associates. The front of the left half was made up of attorneys of the state, there to make sure that Megan would get a sentence as long as they possibly could. Half of the police corps was present as well, either in the aisle in the middle or with their backs against the wall to keep the crowd in control. The crowd itself was restless, the proponents and opponents of Megan throwing each other mean looks and threatening chants. Everybody knew that the only unarmed person in the room was Megan as her weapons were taking from her. Adessi shut the doors loudly and the crowd quieted down into a tense silence. The court’s guard was excited now that there was actually something happening in the court that could get out of hand.
‘All rise,’ he said, forgetting to mention why or who the judge was.
A set of three judges marched in and took their place. Judge Matthews sat in the middle, being the highest authority in the room, flanked by Judge Davis and Judge Boivoirs. The crowd sat back down as Judge Matthews told them to be seated.
‘I welcome you to the courtroom, to the accusation of Megan Jay in the case of the murder of Emma Dermoni. Parties, please announce yourself.’ Matthews read of a paper and seemed uninterested in the case. One of the attorneys got up.
‘I’m attorney Gio Danver and I represent the law and accuse Megan Jay of murder.’ When he was done speaking he sat back down and threw a filthy look at Megan, as if to say ‘I got you there.’ Megan got up too.
‘I’m Megan Jay and represent myself, as I claim to be innocent.’ The crowd behind her applauded and the crowd behind the attorneys hissed at her as she sat back down. Judge Matthews called the court to order.
‘Let’s keep this short,’ Matthews said. ‘So we can be done before lunch. Mister Danver, please rise and defend your case.’
‘Thank you, your honor,’ said Gio as he got up. ‘Your honor, please take a look at the evidence in this bag.’ He put a plastic bag with bullets on the high bench.
‘Bullets?’ Judge Matthews asked, confused.
‘Bullets, seven of them. They were found in the body of Emma Dermoni when she was found in the residence of Megan Jay and Thirza Seraph. Emma Dermoni was murdered.’
‘That much is certain, we want to know if Megan Jay was the murderer.’
‘If it pleases the court I can take over here to plead my innocence, your honor,’ Megan said.
‘Objection!’ Gio cried. 
‘Overruled, please resume your seat, Danver.’ Megan got up and walked up to the high bench and Adessi pulled his gun.
‘I call my gun to the bench.’
‘Denied, we’re not giving a potential murderer a gun.’
‘That’s fair; I call Thirza Seraph – with my gun – to the bench.’ Thirza got up, walked to the bench and sat down there. She then drew Megan’s gun from her purse and put Megan’s gun on the counter. 
‘The evidence will show that the bullets do not fit the size of my gun’s barrel,’ Megan said. ‘Feel free to compare.’
The judge picked up the gun and looked closely at the barrel.
‘They’re not gonna fit in there,’ he deducted.
‘I call Gregory Dermoni to the bench, I’m sure he’s here given that this trial is about his daughter’s death.’ 
‘Objection!’ Gio cried again.
‘Mister Danver, refrain yourself! Just because you’re losing doesn’t mean what she’s doing is wrong.’ Thirza collected the gun from Judge Matthews and went back to her seat while an all too nervous Gregory took place at the witnesses’ bench.
‘I would ask that the court inspect the witness’ gun alike they inspected mine.’
‘Mister Dermoni, your gun, please?’ Reluctantly Gregory drew his gun and handed it over. The judges then called for a short break, so the crowd rose as they left the room and then sat back down. Gregory was told to stay in the witness booth but Megan made her way back to her seat.

Fifteen minutes later the judges came back. Megan had by then made her way through two cups of coffee, brought to her by one of the officers.
‘We find the evidence overwhelming,’ said Judge Matthews once the crowd had quieted down. ‘On the charge of the murder of Emma Dermoni we find the accused, Megan Jay, not guilty. We do, however, wish to arrest Gregory Dermoni on that same charge.’ Gregory knew it had no use to fight this warrant with half the police corps in the room, and with loud cheering from the room’s right half and hissing from the left side he was escorted out of the room.
‘However, we have some questions as to why Emma Dermoni was bound in your bed. Miss Jay?’ The judges tried to hide what seemed to be a perverted smile.
‘We found Emma Dermoni in our house a few weeks ago, determined to murder me.’
‘Who is this “we” you refer to?’
‘Me and Thirza, we were in bed when we heard noise.’
‘What were you doing in that bed?’
‘I hardly believe that’s relevant.’
‘May I remind you that you’re under oath?’ Megan looked at the judge, wondering how to phrase her answer in such a way that it was not technically wrong, but also did not reveal any too personal information.
‘Business,’ she finally said. ‘Business beyond your wildest dreams.’ Thirza blushed. ‘In any case, at that point Emma assaulted us with a knife. I disarmed her and floored her, in which her head hit a cabinet and she lost consciousness. We then decided to keep her around as Gregory and I were in a disagreement and I figured this would speed up the process.’
‘Why was she in your bed?’
‘Comfort, The Dragons are known to treat their prisoners kindly.’
‘Nobody believes that.’ 
‘Fine. We were tipped off that Gregory would attempt to assassinate me. I suppose the interest in my death runs in the family. Either way, we put her in the bed, and Gregory must’ve thought it was me and shot her.’
‘So you’re saying out of tactical defense you knowingly put Emma Dermoni tricking her father into thinking it was her?’
‘It was a method of self-defense, yes.’
‘Sounds like I can charge you for conspiracy, Miss Jay.’ Megan started to lose her temper, something rare.
‘Are you telling me that I’m not allowed to defend myself within my own walls?’ she said enraged.
‘Do not belabor the court, Miss Jay. Mind the regulations.’
‘Fuck the regulations,’ Megan called out as she climbed atop the table. She then ripped her jumpsuit open and took it off. The courtroom, moments before filled with murmuring caused by Megan’s intrepid statement, turned quieter than it had been all morning as Megan revealed her body. Everybody looked shocked, for nobody had ever seen anything quite like it. Megan’s body was covered in scars. Her back seemed to have been mutilated so much it contained no more skin but was merely a compilation of scars, large parts of her legs seemed to have been burned severely and even her arms seemed more scar than skin. Many people in the courtroom looked away as she revealed herself, shocked by the image or horrified by the thoughts of what had caused it. The gang members who had murdered or tortured others seemed to be drenched in realization of what their actions did and even Thirza, who had only seen the entirety of the body in dimly lit bedrooms (or offices) seemed shocked seeing it in full light. Nicky’s jaw dropped; perhaps her own life had not been as bad as she had always thought. Megan was not what you could describe as an attractive girl.
‘Look at me,’ she told the judges. ‘Look at what has been done to me. And you dare deny me to defend myself?’ It took great effort for Megan to control her voice; it quivered badly as she fought the traumas and memories that tried to overcome her, and a tear slowly rolled down her face. A tense silence followed her statement in which Megan climbed off the table and sat back down in her chair.
‘The defense rests,’ she finally said. After that the silence continued as the judges gazed at where Megan had been standing, their eyes empty and their mouths ajar. Megan had not bothered to put her jumpsuit back on, perhaps to keep her statement fresh, and the jumpsuit lay on the table before her. It was police chief Adessi that broke the silence.
‘I know this is highly unusual, Judge Matthews,’ he said as he slowly walked up to the front. ‘But it won’t be the first unusual thing this morning. Could we have a sidebar?’ Matthews seemed confused by this sudden outburst of life and looked at Adessi, surprised.
‘Yeah, sure.’ The three judges and Adessi put their heads together and whispered while Nicky and Thirza tried to convince Megan to put her jumpsuit back on, without success.
‘The Court is prepared to proceed to sentencing,’ Judge Matthews finally said as Adessi turned around, winked at Megan and walked back to the rear or the room. The crowd quieted down for the final time, some of them still throwing glances in Megan’s direction.
‘Given recently obtained evidence, the court has come to the following conclusion.’ He glanced at Megan for a moment and nearly lost his line of thought.
‘The court acknowledges that the defendant, Megan Jay, admitted her involvement in the instant charge and acted knowingly and intentionally. Furthermore, the court also acknowledges that the acknowledged intentions of the defendant, Megan Jay, varied from the outcome of the situation. The court acknowledges that the course of actions was taken in self-defense at the anticipation of a life-threatening situation for the defendant, Megan Jay, and that she therefore cannot be held accountable for the outcome of the situation. The court decides that on the charges of homicide and conspiracy the accused, Megan Jay, is found guilty but not accountable and must therefore be treated as innocent. Megan Jay can no longer be prosecuted for the murder of Emma Dermoni and is free to go.’ Matthews hit his gavel on its base and the judges left, loudly protested by the Dragon’s enemies. Valerius made his way to the front of the court and gave Megan his coat after which they left through the same door as the judges had. Thirza and Nicky followed them. They left the court through the backdoor before the situation within the courtroom, which escalated quickly, would burst into a riot or gang-war. Jeeves was waiting outside and drove them to the Aetius Mansion.
