Nicky sacrificed her mobile phone to function as a delayed detonator. After removing her SIM-card and being reassured by Joshi that he had remotely backed up her private data, he had walked the girls through how to make it set off a charge. Megan, who had the steadiest hands, had used a small Swiss knife to alter the device carefully and she’d placed it at the bottom of the duffle bag. They set the alarm timer for 5 minutes on both phones: Nicky’s for detonation, and Megan’s to know how long they had until then. The detonator got surrounded with some of the spare ammunition and a few grenades. After having observed the house throughout the entire process and with still no sign of Tom they figured he wasn’t watching the windows at all. Slowly and carefully they moved towards Tom’s car and put the duffle bag in the middle of the street in front of it, far from the buildings. After that they got to the rear of his car and pushed it onto the road too until the rear wheels flanked the bag, quietly thanking Tom’s negligence of the handbrake.
With less than half a minute remaining Nicky and Megan found themselves back on the house’s front porch and unlocking the front door. Mere seconds after Megan had closed the front door and they were in some form of cover, the duffle back exploded. The car’s explosion followed half a second later as the fuel tank gave and the combined force shattered most windows on the block and made numerous car alarms go off. Nicky looked at Megan with her eyes big in surprise.
‘Yeah,’ Megan whispered. ‘We may have made that bomb a little big.’
Nicky rolled her eyes as she followed Megan towards the stairs. They heard Tom curse in the master’s bedroom as he saw his car gone up in flames and suddenly Megan ran up the stairs, burst open the bedroom door and shot the bedside table.
‘Leave it,’ she told Tom who had indeed been reaching for his handgun. 
‘Jesus, Meg! What the fuck!’ he replied. Nicky had come into bedroom too and locked the bedroom door as well as closed the curtains. Tom backed into a corner.
‘You fucked up, Tom,’ Megan told him, holding him at gunpoint. ‘Get in the chair.’ She gestured towards a chair next to a dresser and Nicky nudged Tom in the right direction. He was scared; pissing of either Megan or Nicky was a terrible idea, the whole town knew that. Somehow he seemed to have pissed them both off, so he knew better than to argue and sat down in the chair.
‘Secure him,’ Megan suggested. Nicky looked at her.
‘How?’
‘There should be a roll of pink bondage tape still in the drawer of the bedside table – unless Tom couldn’t help himself...’ Nicky walked over to the bedside table and found the tape in it.
‘It’s hideous,’ she commented as she walked back over to Tom and taped his legs to the legs of the chair.’
‘Don’t look at me, the color was Thirza’s choice,’ Megan replied. Nicky tied Tom’s hands to each other behind the back of the chair with a lot of tape.
‘What do you want from me?’ Tom asked quietly, unable to hide how scared he was. Both Nicky and Megan smiled at that.
‘Nothing,’ Megan answered. ‘Your watch has ended. I’m kicking you out of the gang.’
‘You can’t do that,’ Tom claimed. ‘It’s a lifetime deal. Besides, I still have the tattoo, twice.’
‘Yeah, about that,’ Megan said as she put the gun back in the rim of her pants and drew two butterfly knives from one of the pockets. Tom’s eyes grew larger in panic.
‘You- You’re kidding, right?!’ he stammered as the realization hit him. Megan tossed one of the knives to Nicky.
‘Meg, he’s gonna scream,’ Nicky noted. ‘And it’s not like the cops aren’t already on their way about the car bomb.’
‘Fair point,’ Megan admitted. ‘We’re gonna have to shut him up.’
Nicky walked over to the bedside table and pulled the drawer all the way out, then opened the dresser only to find that empty too.
‘Sorry, I figured you would have a gag around here somewhere, too,’ Nicky defended. Megan laughed.
‘Honestly, I thought we did,’ she responded. ‘I guess Thirza brought them all to the mansion.’
‘Ah well,’ Nicky said, using the knife to cut her own underwear with surprising ease after which she stuffed them into Tom’s mouth.
‘This’ll do,’ she said. Megan looked at Tom and realized the pink tape and somehow matching pink undies still visible in his mouth made the atmosphere look a lot more innocent than it was. She pulled up his right sleeve and looked at the Black Dragons emblem tattooed on it. Tom had started to scream into the panties at that point and had sweat on his forehead while Nicky did the same on his left arm and rubbed the blade on the ink.
‘How deep do you think we have to go to get it off?’ she asked.
‘Better safe than sorry,’ Megan replied. She slid the edge of her blade against the tattoo and broke the skin. Tom started screaming as loud as he could while Nicky broke the skin on his other arm too and began to cut his ink out of his arm. Tom struggled in the chair as the girls took their time and slowly the pool of blood on the ground extended around their feet. He screamed and sweated heavily, and his shaking body made the girls’ work harder, but they seemed not to mind. When Megan was almost slicing up Tom’s arm his head dropped, passed out from the pain.
‘What a pussy,’ Nicky commented. She had finished her side and was holding the patch of Tom’s arm with the tattoo on it. 
‘So what’s next?’ she asked. Megan threw her patch of Tom’s arm on top of the other one and drew a Zippo lighter from her pocket, which she threw in Nicky’s direction. Nicky caught it with ease and examined it. It was engraved.
‘For Megan Jay, may I light up your world in the darkest of times,’ Nicky read aloud.
‘Tom gave it to me,’ Megan explained. ‘Ages ago, back when he was still loyal to the cause.’
‘Seems like it meant a lot to you,’ Nicky said, but Megan shrugged.
‘I kept it because it was a good lighter, not because it meant something. But it seems the right way to end the bond. With the fuel cans in the kitchen, I mean.’
By the time the duo had fetched the fuel cans and emptied them over most of the bedroom Tom had come back to consciousness and continued to squirm in the chair. He seemed to try to push Nicky’s panties out of his mouth, but she’d pushed them in deep and he couldn’t seem to move them enough to get them out.
They had soaked him with the fuel too. Nicky and Megan both believed that if someone has done you wrong, you should make them suffer and not give them a quick way out. But as discussed earlier, he could easily become a problem alongside the Wither. Burning him alive seemed a proper enough alternative.
The girls moved towards the blown out windows and opened the curtains back up. Nicky climbed through the window and lowered herself onto the roof of the porch. She jumped onto the ground and made her way over to the Bugatti while Megan climbed through the window too and turned around to face Tom. She opened the lighter and spawned a flame.
‘Keep your head cool, Tom. You had it coming.’ 
She tossed the lighter onto the bed and jumped onto the ground as well as the fuel caught fire and spread fast. Tom screamed in agony as the flames engulfed him while Megan got into the Bugatti, appreciating the fire in the side mirror as they drove off.
Their satisfaction wasn’t to last long. They were only a few blocks from the fire when Megan’s phone rang.
‘This is Jay,’ she stated.
‘I know,’ Valerius replied. ‘Get to the ER, Thirza got shot.’
