The following day started fairly similar, though I’d slept slightly better. The first day had left me exhausted and the guards seemed to leave us alone at night. Sarah had crawled into my bed; I’d forgotten about her fear of the dark and had dropped into my bed as soon as we had been brought back to our rooms. She had invited herself and I didn’t stop her. Truth be told, I actually liked having her in my arms. It made me feel less alone.
During breakfast Howard showed us the fresh news broadcast from that morning, which ended up being more of a recap from last night’s news. No new developments had been made, so they showed the mayor’s speech again. Then they repeated how the cars had been found and how the security footage had not yielded anything.  Meanwhile at the table, Gary was still missing. The worst of scenarios started forming in my head and I could tell I wasn’t the only one. The company at the table seemed quieter. Especially Nicky, who spent most of the time looking at her plate and trying to go unnoticed. Even the always chatty Thalia seemed at a loss for words. The severity of our situation seemed to slowly seep into our awareness, and it didn’t improve the atmosphere.
After breakfast we were brought to the gym. Per the recommendation of Simon and Jaylynn everyone participated in the work-out, which was led by the suggestions of the boys that seemed to know what they were doing. 
‘We get a reasonable amount of time here,’ Reuben explained as he pointed at the clock. Sarah, Sue, and Thalia had asked him what would be best for them. They didn’t work out at home and weren’t sure how to start off, and Reuben seemed to enjoy the attention.
‘You shouldn’t spend that entirely on one machine,’ he continued. ‘It’s important to vary the muscles you use, so you can train most efficiently. It’s also important to warm your muscles up before going heavy, so let’s start with some simple push-ups.’ He dropped to the floor and started doing push-ups, the girls following his example.
‘How come you work out at home and Sarah doesn’t?’ I asked Jaylynn. She was bench pressing and had asked me to be her spotter.
‘I care about it and Sarah doesn’t,’ Jaylynn answered with effort. She used the power rack during her presses which made me feel rather useless other than to hold her jacket. I noticed Reuben and the girls were doing sit-ups now.
‘What made you care?’ I asked. Jaylynn half grinned.
‘Believe it or not, I wanted to impress Reuben,’ she said.  ‘At first, anyway. He’s a junior trainer at the gym and I thought he was hot.’
‘He’s an ass,’ I commented carelessly, even though he seemed nice enough to the girls at that moment.
‘Well yeah,’ Jaylynn said as she put the bar back in the rack. ‘I realized that, but the working out felt good so I kept doing it. Your turn.’ She got off of the bench and started to take some weight off the bar as I took my jacket off too. Reluctantly and with a sigh I took her place on the bench. It was warm and slightly wet with her sweat.
‘Oh, eww,’ I commented. Jaylynn grinned again.
‘Welcome to gym-life,’ she replied. I rolled my eyes as I grabbed the bar and arched my back, pushing as much of my body off the bench as I could, hoping to avoid the sweat.
‘Put your ass back on the bench,’ Jaylynn said as soon as she noticed. ‘That’s cheating, it makes it a lot easier and above all less effective.’
‘Fine,’ I said as I laid down properly. ‘But you owe me a shower.’
‘I could use one myself, too,’ she replied. ‘And I’m sure we’re not the only ones.’ I looked up at her from the bench as I moved the bar up and down. Jaylynn wasn’t paying attention to me at all, but was looking at her sister instead.
‘What are they doing?’ I asked her.
‘Treadmill,’ she responded. ‘Looks like he’s focusing on training their stamina.’
‘Not a bad idea actually,’ I admitted. ‘Whatever is going to happen, I’m pretty sure we don’t want the youngest involved. They’ll have to run.’
‘Oh, how heroic of you,’ she replied sarcastically.
‘Am I wrong?’ 
‘No, but to say it like that...’ She seemed offended.
‘Look,’ I said, putting the bar in the rack and sitting up to face her. ‘You already told me to look after Sarah the best I could – and I have been, I let her sleep in my arms every night ‘cause she’s scared of the dark. We already agreed this isn’t going to end well. You literally said “If this is going to end bad, that means fighting.” Given the level of protection you’re trying to enforce on your sister already even though no one is actually harming us... It just made me think you’d end up telling her to run and hide, not fight.’
‘I would, but-‘
‘Who’s really being all heroic here, then?’ I asked teasingly, making Jaylynn look at me with a mixture of anger and amusement. She rolled her eyes and made her way over to the stationary bikes, I followed closely.
‘So how far did you let Reuben get?’ I asked her as we each tried to find a speed that worked for us. We could see everyone else without too much effort. I noticed Reuben was showing off again, walking backwards on the treadmill while keeping an eye on his trainees. His treadmill was going a considerable amount slower than those the girls were running at.
‘Well, it took a while for me to find his schedule,’ Jaylynn explained, looking at him too. ‘By the time I knew when he was working I was already working out daily and I kind of just kept that up. I never let him get anywhere, he didn’t seem interested in me.’
‘Ouch,’ I said, but Jaylynn didn’t seem to care much. ‘How did you know?’ I added.
‘He flirted with every girl that walked into that place, checking them out and what not. Yet he barely said hi to me at all.’
‘What a douche,’ I commented. Jaylynn grinned.
‘I’m glad we agree on that.’

When the guards came to collect us sometime later, Howard was with them. He kept close to the door as the guards kept their backs to the wall and their guns at the ready while they waited for us to group up.
‘Listen up,’ he said as soon as we were all there. Sarah had looked us up and Jaylynn rested her head on Sarah’s as they listened to Howard, their hands folded together on Sarah’s belly.
‘I was supposed to do this yesterday,’ Howard continued. ‘But given the events that transpired here I saw no opportunity to. Hence I’m doing it now.’ I noticed Keith and Sue shared a remarkable similar stance to that of Jaylynn and Sarah and wondered if it was a typical sibling thing to do; I had never really been close with my brother before he died, so I wouldn’t know. Reuben and Eirin were noticeably far apart, having both Thalia and Reuben between them.
‘We realize the facilities in your rooms aren’t exactly sufficient to clean yourself with. Which is why every day, after your gym time, you will be given shower time. In the shower room you will also find a clean tracksuit to wear.’
‘Sounds like quite the undertaking,’ Jaylynn whispered to me. ‘Clean clothes every day? This thing is bigger than I thought...’
‘Yeah, no shit,’ I told her, making her raise an eyebrow at me. Howard threw an impatient look in our direction, but continued to talk nonetheless.
‘If you would be so kind as to follow us without uproar we won’t have to touch your filthy, sweaty bodies,’ he said, after which he turned around and left. The group followed him, albeit reluctant. The guards closed in behind us, guns at the ready.
‘Don’t let your hopes get too high,’ Jaylynn told Sarah. ‘I’m not entirely confident with their intentions yet.’
‘Historically, it never ended well,’ I concurred. ‘Didn’t the Germans tell the Jews they were getting a shower when they were actually – you know.’ 
‘Yeah I totally wanted that image in my head,’ Jaylynn replied.
Moment later we stopped at two open doors. Per Howard’s instructions the boys headed into the right door, and the girls went through the left one. It landed us in a room that felt strangely similar to the changing rooms of the gym in high school. There was one wooden bench stretched throughout the room on one side, going along the corners too. On the bench were seven red bundles of clothing, neatly spaced apart. On the other side was a door with a toilet behind it, a small sink, and a doorway without a door. Behind that doorway was another room containing a dozen shower-heads and knobs, a soap dispenser between every other knob, and a single floor drain in the middle of the room. While I was still looking at the showers, Jaylynn and Sarah had begun undressing at one of the bundles, which appeared to be our clean clothes as well as a big, soft towel.
‘How do you know which one is yours?’ Sue asked her, trying not to look at them.
‘Your name is written just under the loop of the jacket,’ Jaylynn answered, with her back turned. ‘Haven’t you noticed?’ I checked my jacket to notice she was right. I’d seen the curly gold lettering on the black tag, but had assumed it was a brand name. Instead, I now noticed it read “Ashley Conroy.”
I found my bundle at the front of the line at the same time Jaylynn confidently stepped into the shower room, followed by her sister. I noticed Sue had a little more trouble getting the confidence to undress in front of the rest, even though we all had the decency to not look at each other. Well, most of us.
‘Bet you’re having a good time now that you’re getting to see Ashley naked, Nicky?’ Eirin said teasingly.
‘Would be a step up from watching you go at it with Reuben,’ she shot back. Thalia tried to suppress a smile, and so did I. Sue used the distraction to hurry into the shower room.
‘What’s that supposed to mean?’ Eirin asked, obviously offended.
‘What do you think it means?’ Nicky sneered as she made her way to the showers too.
‘Pardon me for showing my boyfriend some love,’ Eirin defended as she followed Nicky. I noticed Thalia hung back a little and wondered if she was more ashamed than she had let on. Jaylynn and Sarah had already finished their shower and reached for their towels when Thalia and I headed in.
‘Well I did show Ashley love, you’re not wrong in that,’ Nicky continued. ‘But I did it briefly and I’ve interacted with more people than just her!’
‘You say that like she’s your girlfriend,’ Thalia told her. She seemed slightly choked up. Nicky chuckled.
‘In her dreams,’ she responded. I felt their eyes burn in my back as they tried to get a response from me, but I closed my eyes and pretended to be alone as I washed the soap out of my hair.
‘I’m just saying you’re not in here with just Reuben,’ Nicky continued to Eirin. I heard one of the guards yell something into the room but couldn’t make sense of it, but Sarah informed us that we had five minutes before we would be brought back to our rooms, dressed or not.
‘I never claimed I’m in here with just Reuben. I share a room with Sue and you, after all,’ Eirin defended.
‘In which you solely talk about Reuben,’ Sue added quietly. She’d dressed herself quickly and was at the door, waiting with Jaylynn and Sarah. They smiled faintly and so did I, but the rest seemed to have missed the comment.
‘You didn’t have much of a choice in that, did you,’ Nicky said. ‘I bet if you had the choice you’d be sharing a room with Reuben, too!’
‘Poor Reuben, if that were the case,’ I told Jaylynn as I joined her at the door. A smile played at her mouth.
‘He wouldn’t have the stamina,’ she answered me. Sarah looked up at her confused, but Jaylynn didn’t elaborate.
‘I noticed in the gym, earlier, that he runs out of breath fast,’ Sue said, desperate to be part of the conversation. Jaylynn and I burst into laughter, interrupting the ongoing conversation between Nicky and Eirin and they looked at us infuriated. Nicky opened her mouth to say something about it, but right at that moment the guards opened the door to escort us back to our rooms. The shower seemed to have slightly lifted our spirits. Even though the experience had been slightly awkward, most of us generally avoided public showers, it felt good to be clean again after the work-out, though the work-out made me feel better about myself, too. Also, the fact that we hadn’t been gassed in the showers was a notable good sign.

The start of dinner that evening still felt rather awkward. Nicky and Eirin were no longer arguing, but both seemed to be in a bad mood and they threw mean looks at each other. Sue seemed annoyed with the both of them; she refused to look at either of them, ignored her brother’s repeated attempts to ask if she was alright and used her knife aggressively on mashed potatoes. Nicky seemed uninvolved with Sarah and Thalia, who were actively chatting, and I wondered if it was because of Eirin, or rather because there was still no sign of Gary. Jaylynn was oblivious to tension at the table; she was enjoying her dinner and threw an occasional glance at Howard, apparently waiting for the news. Howard seemed to have lost his patience with us, because he started the video without a word and his smile had faded. He seemed agitated, and disappointed.
“Bad news in the Commack disappearances,” the anchor read with a sigh. He had a sad look on his face.
“The body of Gary Donnaghue has been found at the Commack Cemetery,” he continued. “By none other than the mayor of Commack, Thomas Greenberg. Jane is still in Commack and at the scene right now. Jane, what do we know?”
“Thank you, Devon,” Jane responded. Devon had turned around to face the screen behind him on which she was shown. She was standing at the roadside with the closed gate to her left and the sign reading “Commack Cemetery” to her right. There were a lot of police cars flashing red and blue on the driveway and several cops seemed to be searching the cemetery with dogs. “The police won’t let anyone onto the cemetery grounds at the moment, except for Gary’s parents moments ago. They wouldn’t address the press, but Mayor Greenberg made a brief appearance at the gate earlier and gave an unofficial statement regarding the events.”
“What did he say?”
“He stated that he found the body when visiting his daughters grave, earlier today. He said Gary appeared to have a big wound on his head, but that he was not at liberty to disclose anything else.”
“Have the police released a statement yet?”
“Not yet I’m afraid,” Jane said. “I hope to know more in a few hours,” she added. The screen behind Devon went back to blank and he looked back into the camera.
“More on that, then, tonight after a heartbreaking plea from the parents of two of the victims; Keith and Sue Williams, tonight at nine on this channel. Please stay tuned while-” Howard paused the video and smiled in a way I didn’t like.
‘I’ll leave you to it,’ he said, barely able to hold back from snickering as he left the room. At the table no one spoke, and no one ate or even moved for several minutes until Tristan broke the uncomfortable silence.
‘You did this,’ he told Nicky. She looked at him with a mixture of betrayal and guilt, but didn’t respond.
‘Bullshit,’ Jaylynn told him. Sarah seemed proud of her sister then, though I wasn’t sure why. ‘This is nobody’s fault but of the people that put us into this bloody mess.’ She looked at Tristan angrily.
‘To be fair, if Nicky and Ashley hadn’t kissed...’ Eirin started, but I interrupted her.
‘Don’t pull me into this,’ I snapped. ‘I didn’t initiate anything and even if I had, you can’t blame the kiss for Gary missing a step.’
‘Nor can either be blamed for Gary’s body turning up in a public place somewhere,’ Jaylynn reminded us. ‘You’re all focusing on the wrong thing.’
‘Fuck that,’ Tristan told her. ‘What Nicky and Ashley did was wrong, I agree with Eirin.
‘Dude, Eirin didn’t even see any of it happen,’ Keith responded. ‘She was too busy “exercising” with Reuben in the corner.
‘She’s just hating on Nicky because of what happened in the showers,’ Sue added to her brother’s defense.
‘Wait, what happened in the shower?’ Simon asked.
‘Eirin was being a pain to Nicky,’ Sarah briefly explain. Simon raised an eyebrow.
‘She asked if I was enjoying seeing Ashley naked,’ Nicky explained with a sigh, and a quiet voice.
‘Well, of course you were,’ Simon answered. ‘Anyone would.’
‘I don’t think that was the point,’ Sue told him, but Simon was looking at me.
‘Stop picturing her naked,’ Jaylynn told him. ‘We have bigger problems.’
‘Do we?’ Tristan asked her. ‘I mean I realize this abduction thing is more important than picturing Ashley naked but it’s not like we can do anything about that.’
‘About which one?’ Simon asked jokingly, earning him a couple angry looks.
‘Are we just going to ignore the fact that Gary is dead?’ Sarah asked.
‘He wasn’t found in the tracksuit,’ Jaylynn said. ‘I know, because it is obvious and red and if he were found in it the reporter would have said so.’
‘Fair point,’ I admitted, glad to move on from the kiss.
‘Yes, excellent deduction, Sherlock,’ Tristan blurted out. ‘How’s that gonna help us get out of here?’
‘It means we shouldn’t underestimate these people,’ she defended. ‘They know what they’re doing.’
‘Yes, the armed guards all around hadn’t made that obvious yet, thank you.’
‘I don’t like you,’ Sarah confessed, looking at Tristan.
‘Seconded,’ Jaylynn and I choired. I suppressed a faint smile.
‘You don’t have to like me,’ Tristan quickly said as Sue raised her hand and opened her mouth. ‘Trust me, if it were up to me I wouldn’t be here.’
‘That goes for any of us,’ Reuben said. He’d been quiet through most of the conversation, but seemed fed up with it.
‘Gary was a good friend of mine,’ he continued. ‘He’s dead now. And all you’re going on about is whose fault it is, or what it says about who’s keeping us here. Does anyone care the slightest bit about Gary, at all?’
‘If you need a moment to process it, that’s fine,’ Jaylynn responded. ‘But whether or not we care about Gary doesn’t matter. He’s dead, he’s not coming back.’ I noticed Reuben was trying to hold back tears and wondered whether it was because of Gary’s loss or simply because of how the rest treated it. Whichever may be, it killed the conversation and everyone’s appetite.

I hoped the night would calm everyone down and perhaps with some sleep we could approach the matter from a different side over breakfast. Granted, I wasn’t sure what matter, nor in which way it would help to talk about it. However, as the conversation would make time pass faster, it beat silence.  It bothered me that we hadn’t been found yet, but also that the news hadn’t reported a ransom call yet. We couldn’t be sure whether Howard was showing us all the news broadcasts, nor whether he was showing us new ones, but if he was, the police was just screwing around and running after its own tail. Perhaps that was Howard’s plan; to get us hopeless and depressed by showing us specific parts of the news broadcasts.
‘They kind of look like pajamas, don’t they?’ Sarah suddenly said, interrupting my thoughts. She had curled up in my arms a while back and I thought she had been trying to fall asleep, but apparently her mind had been active as well. It had been pretty warm, so we’d taken our jackets off and thrown them on her bed instead. Perhaps the heat was keeping her up.
‘What, our tracksuits?’ 
‘No, the guard uniforms.’ She wiggled slightly and turned to look up at me, and I looked down into her eyes as I thought about the guard uniforms.
‘You’re right,’ I realized. ‘They do kind of look like pajamas.’ I saw a playful twinkle in her eyes as they reflected the moonlight coming through the tiny window.
‘Let’s call them that then,’ I told her. ‘Pajamas, instead of guards.’ She giggled a little.
‘Alright!’ she said. ‘You’ll have to tell Jay over breakfast tomorrow, and I’ll tell Nicky and Thalia.’ 
‘Of course.’ I noticed it lightened her mood, and perhaps it would lighten the mood of the others too. Thinking of them as “pajamas” rather than guards would make them less intimidating, perhaps. It would help us keep it together. Then again, maybe not.
Sarah had just dozed off when the Pajamas banged on our door. She quickly jumped to her own bed and crawled away into the corner as the door unlocked and four of them entered the room. Without a word they dragged me from my bed, took me into the hallway and locked Sarah up on her own. They held me firmly, one man on either side, and pulled me through the hallways and staircases to a floor lower. I was forced into a dimly lit room and pushed onto a chair matching to the ones in the dining room. The men tied my ankles to the legs of the chair and my wrists to the arms, then took position in the corners.
Howard entered shortly after with a bald man that had big, blue eyes and a terrifying smile.
‘You’ve been a bad girl, Ashley,’ Howard said. The bald man moved to the back of the room, behind me, and it bothered me that I couldn’t see what he was up to.
‘Do you know what Santa gives to bad girls?’
‘Coal,’ I replied. It seemed best to play along even though nothing of the situation seemed good.
‘Right you are!’ Howard exclaimed. ‘Sadly for you, this is Martin, not Santa.’ The bald guy had walked up behind me and put his cold hands on my shoulders, making me shiver.
‘Hello Ashley,’ he said darkly, squeezing my shoulders and making me wince.
‘Now, a friendly reminder that she has to survive, Martin,’ Howard told the guy. His grip loosened and he slowly let go.
‘I’ll do my best,’ he replied. ‘I hope she can last.’
Howard left the room quickly while Martin loosely laid another rope on my left arm.
‘Nice of you to take your jacket off for me,’ Martin told me as he grabbed the loose ends of the rope and pulled it left and right, slowly burning it into my arm. ‘But bad deeds still deserve punishment,’ he added. I protested and tried to get my arm loose, but it had no use.
‘I didn’t do shit!’ I yelled. 
‘Is that so?’ he asked calmly, continuing to pull on the rope until my arm bled.
‘Yes!’ I cried, tears of pain seeping down my face as Martin moved the rope slightly and repeated the process.
‘Then why are you here, girl?’ he asked. He had gestured for one of the pajamas to grab another piece of rope and copy his movements on my other arm. They happily obliged. 
‘I don’t know!’ I cried, squirming wildly in the chair and screaming in pain as I watched my blood drip onto the armrests. Martin hit me in the face, making me scream even louder.
‘Liar!’ he yelled. He was enjoying this. He handed his rope to another pajama who gratefully took over as he moved out of sight, only to return moments later with a large bolt cutter.
‘You’re dishonest with me, girl!’ he exclaimed happily.
‘I’m really not!’ I cried, barely able to stop crying enough to close my mouth and pronounce it. My arms were burning badly, even though they only bled faintly. He hit me in the face again.
‘Don’t lie to me, girl. I can’t stand liars!’ He stroked my face with the bolt cutter and continued to slide it down the side of my body, all the way to my knee.
‘I’m gonna take your finger, for lying to me.’ He told me. I shook my head and made fists so my fingers wouldn’t be sticking out. My blood slowly started dripping from the arm rests onto the ground.  My arms were covered with burn marks, and wet with blood. My face was red too, but wet with tears instead. Martin nodded as he pried the fingers from my right hand open and eventually he stretched the ring finger, pushing it as far back as he could so I had no control over it.
‘Hold this for me,’ he told the pajama on my right side who grabbed my finger and kept it stretched as Martin opened the bolt cutter and put it around my finger, nodding again as I still shook my head, screaming both in pain and for help as I watched him close the handles and the blades slide into my finger.


I woke up in a small, windowless room that was barely bigger than the mattress I was on. One of the Pajamas had banged on the door and announced I would be picked up in five minutes, as if  I had to prepare myself. There was no light source in the room, but my eyes were somewhat used to the dark; I could see fairly well. The mattress had dark stains on it and so had my clothes. I couldn’t see the state of my arms; my jacket had been put back on me and I was in no mood to lift the sleeves to check. There was a bandage on my hand which testified of medical attention but failed to conceal the fact that my finger was missing.
‘Fucking hell,’ I said quietly, with a lot of effort. Slowly I realized that last night hadn’t been just another bad dream. Along with the realization my nerves seemed to wake up, too. My arms and head started hurting, but it was nothing in comparison to the agony in my hand. I pulled myself up against the wall as I heard more Pajamas approach. When the door opened I raised my arm to shield my eyes against the light, and to my surprise they let me. They seemed more humane as they transported me to the dining room; I was not pushed or shoved, not even yelled at. Perhaps Martin had crossed a line even in their opinion.
Sarah let out a relieved and loud sigh as I entered the dining room. I could tell she hadn’t slept much, nor had she eaten. Thalia had been trying to console her, by the looks of it, to no avail. The others stared at me as I walked over to my seat except for Nicky and Jaylynn. Nicky stared at her unused plate instead and looked very pale, whereas Jaylynn continued to eat as if nothing happened.
‘Morning,’ I groaned.
‘You’re not dead,’ she stated.
‘Not far from it, though,’ I replied. I tried to keep my right hand below the table and poured the coffee with my left.
‘What’d they do to you?’ she asked. I couldn’t tell whether it was concern or fascination in her voice, but slid my hand higher up my leg until the light fell on it. Jaylynn looked at it, and so did Simon.
‘Bloody hell,’ Jaylynn whispered quietly as she lowered her silverware and got pale. I looked down to realize it looked a lot worse than I thought; the bandage was more red than white and tightly wound around the stump of my ring finger. Simon was at a loss for words and couldn’t take his eyes off my hand, catching the attention of Sarah and Nicky who kept their eyes fixed on me. With my left arm I lifted my right sleeve slightly, revealing the first few burn marks. The blood had clothed somewhat, but they still seemed fresh and hurt a lot.
‘How many?’ Jaylynn asked.
‘Dozen, give or take,’ I responded. ‘All the way up and down both arms.’
‘Why?’ Simon asked.
‘You tell me,’ I told him as I hid my hand back under the table and grabbed a sandwich. ‘Why any of this?’ I added.
‘Do you think they’re gonna do more?’ he asked. 
‘Of course they’re gonna do more,’ Jaylynn snapped at him. ‘To her, to me, to you. To everyone.’
‘He said I’d been a bad girl,’ I said absent-minded, interrupting their conversation.
‘Gross,’ Simon said.
‘Not in that way,’ I corrected. ‘More like, this was supposed to be a punishment for bad behavior.
‘I’d say you have a point, but I don’t remember you doing anything,’ Jaylynn answered.
‘Well, there’s the kiss,’ Simon said.
‘Which you can’t seem to get over,’ Jaylynn replied immediately. ‘Also, I’m fairly sure that was Nicky’s initiative, not Ash’s.’ 
‘Maybe that’s the point,’ I realized aloud. ‘People here seem to care about one another; Nicky about me, you about Sarah, Keith about Sue. Maybe I got the punishment because she fucked up.’
‘That’d be mental,’ Simon reasoned.
‘But brilliant,’ Jaylynn added. ‘I mean, honestly it would work on me. If I’d get roughed up for something I’d done I deserved that, but I wouldn’t be able to stand the idea of Sarah getting hurt ‘cause I did something.’
‘I could be wrong,’ I told her. ‘It could be we just get tortured ‘cause they want to torture us.’
‘That doesn’t seem too unlikely,’ Simon agreed.
‘I don’t know,’ she said. ‘There’s usually a reason.’
‘You keep doing this,’ I told them both. ‘You keep having useless conversations about why we’re here or what’s going to happen and it doesn’t make a difference what so ever.’
‘We’ve got to pass the time somehow, don’t we?’ Jaylynn responded. ‘Don’t tell me you still think we’ll be out soon?’
‘I don’t know,’ I told her. ‘I’d hope so.’
David leaned in, awkwardly half hanging over Simon’s lap as he responded.
‘We’re not getting out alive,’ he whispered ominously. 
‘It’s not like they’re murdering us,’ Simon told him, pushing his back against the chair
‘Of course not,’ David said as if it was obvious. ‘They’re waiting for us to kill each other. They’re watching.’ He sat back up and continued breakfast as if he hadn’t said anything at all. A short silence followed.
‘That was odd,’ Jaylynn eventually said. She hadn’t taken her eyes off David, but he didn’t seem to notice.
‘It was,’ I agreed. Then again, David had always seemed weird to me. Maybe there was truth to the satanic sacrifice rumors that went around. ‘What did they say on the news?’ I asked in an attempt to distract myself.
‘Usual nonsense,’ Jaylynn said. ‘They’re clueless to who killed Gary, are no further with their investigations and just speculate about where we are. They’re fairly sure we’re still in the area, though. I guess that’s something.’
‘No it’s not,’ I rejected. ‘Because we’ve been in that damn area all week and they can’t find us, so it doesn’t help much.’
‘Why are you being so negative?’ Jaylynn asked. ‘I mean, I realize I’m not the brightest, usually. But this attitude is depressing.’
‘Oh, I don’t know,’ I snapped. ‘Perhaps the fact that I’m having breakfast with guns aimed at my head or that they cut off my fucking finger. You tell me.’
‘That’s fair,’ Simon reasoned. ‘But it’s less fair that you’re taking it out on us. Take it out on the workout machines, later.’
