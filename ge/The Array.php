    A long and restless night later we were rudely awoken by someone banging on our door.
‘Escort for breakfast,’ a deep voice chanted from behind it. ‘Be ready and don’t try anything stupid.’ I rolled onto my back and yawned as I stretched my arms while Sarah looked at me with a half-smile.
‘I’m pretty sure I slept better than you did,’ she said.
‘Usually I have more space and less stress,’ I replied sleepily. I got out of the bed as the door unlocked allowing Sarah to get up quickly before the door opened wide. One of Howard’s mercenaries signaled us to come out using his gun. Given his convincing argument we obeyed without question and hurried into the hallway.
There were a lot more armed men in the hallway. I saw more red tracksuits too, slouched, tired and unmotivated alike Sarah and myself. The guards seemed aware the long night had left us less fierce or perhaps their general approach had become slightly less severe. We were allowed to walk on our own, albeit with a gun to our back nudging us to walk faster and a slap to the head for every groan or complaint, but it beat being dragged. At the end of the hallway we arrived back at the dining room where the guards took position with their backs to the wall. They locked the door we had come through.
Howard was already there. He was standing at a big television that was wheeled in on a cart and put where Nicky and the mayor had been assigned to sit. Nicky had been moved to the other head of the table, next to Sarah, who seemed pleased to have someone between her and the loudmouthed Tristan. Howard pushed a video tape into a VCR and waited patiently while everyone sank into their chairs and poured their first drink of the day. The dinner table had been stocked with numerous amounts of food and drinks for breakfast. If it wasn’t for the armed guards and the fact that we were prisoners here, it would have outdone the best hotels.
‘Morning Jaylynn,’ I said as I filled my mug with coffee while she filled hers with tea. I handed the coffee pot to Simon.
‘How’s Sarah?’ she asked, making no secret of her intentions.
‘Considering circumstances, alright-ish,’ I answered. ‘We slept together.’ Simon turned his head so quickly that his hand holding the coffee pot swayed away from his mug, soaking a basket of blueberry muffins with it instead as he looked at me with eyes wide in surprise. I tried to hide my smile behind my mug as I sipped it.
‘That better not mean what he thinks it does,’ Jaylynn replied while nodding her head at Simon, amused. ‘She’s a tad young, not to mention a girl,’ she added. ‘Didn’t you have something with that geek boy? I saw it in some magazine…’
‘Arthur isn’t a geek, he’s a gamer,’ I corrected her. ‘There’s a difference. But I’m not excluding girls just yet, either way. Things between Arty and me aren’t going great,’ I added, messing with Simon’s brain again while I helped him save the few muffins that weren’t soaked with coffee. Jaylynn looked at Sarah and opened her mouth to say something, but Howard interrupted.
‘Good morning everyone, thanks for coming,’ he said. ‘I’ve taken the liberty of recording the news this morning. If you could all quiet down and have a look.’ He hit play on the remote and took place behind the cart as the tape started playing. It showed the news room of one of the bigger channels. The news anchor had a serious look on his face while the rolling text in the bottom of the screen spoke of a mass-abduction.
“Breaking news coming from Commack, east New York, this morning as thirteen teenagers went missing on the same evening after being invited to a dinner party at their mayors residence.” The camera put the anchor on the left half of the screen while the right half started showing pictures of us and our drivers. 
“After the teenagers failed to show up the mayor of Commack, Thomas Greenberg, alerted the parents each of which assured him their children had been picked up by the hired drivers. The drivers, each of which driving a black, luxury four-door sedan, are still at large. The public is asked to keep an eye out for the people shown on screen. If you do see any of them do not approach them, especially the drivers can be dangerous. Please contact the authorities with any information you have instead. Updates will follow when available, more details on the matter can be found on our website and in the regular news at eight.” Howard paused the video and put the remote on top of the television.
‘I’m sure you people have lots to discuss,’ he said as he walked past the table. He grabbed a croissant and wandered towards one of the doors, taking a bite and then blindly waving it at us.
‘I’ll leave you to it.’ Two of the guards unlocked and opened the door Howard had walked to and locked it again after letting him through. Once the doors had closed behind him everybody started talking. Jaylynn, who hadn’t stopped eating while the video played, swallowed her baked beans before she said something, without looking at me.
‘I was wrong,’ she admitted. I looked at her with a raised eyebrow before realizing she wouldn’t see that.
‘About what?’ I asked, but I had to wait for her to swallow another bite.
‘I thought the party invitation had been a frame-up. Now I’m thinking either the drivers got bribed or threatened, or switched out.’
‘And now does that make a difference to our situation?’ I’d prepared some toast for myself and tried to eat it without making a mess.
‘It really doesn’t,’ she said. I rolled my eyes and looked at Sarah, deep in conversation with Thalia, who was blushing, and Nicky, who kept throwing looks in our direction with a giggle.
‘I think your sister is talking about you,’ I told Jaylynn. She followed my gaze but seemed unimpressed.
‘She’s my sister, Ashley. She does that sometimes.’

After breakfast, contrary to my assumptions, we were not escorted back to our rooms. Through a different hallway we ended up in a room similar in size and decoration to the dining room. Instead of a table and chairs, however, this room hosted work-out equipment. There were a few cameras mounted high on the wall, in the corners,
‘You have ninety minutes to use as you please,’ one of the guards yelled with a strong accent. ‘I suggest you use them well.’ A bright, digital clock above the door started counting down the time as the guards left and locked the door behind them.  
As the door locked behind us Sarah made her way over to her sister and hugged her tight. Sue and Keith did the same thing, while Eirin and Reuben had wasted no second to reunite their tongues. Tristan had somehow gained the roll of leader among the boys with his loud and obnoxious behavior; other than Reuben and Keith they all followed him to wherever he went, copying his workout laughing obnoxiously at each other and trying to impress. They threw an occasional look our way to see if we were drooling yet, only to discover we weren’t even interested. Eirin and Reuben had made their way to a lonely corner where they started showing more skin and less clothes while the other girls, me, and Keith found a comfortable enough place to sit on the floor. I decided to stay on my feet; I’d been sitting enough during breakfast and preferred to be able to see the entire room. As an added bonus, it also took Eirin and Reuben out of our line of sight, but not before Jaylynn made a comment about it. 
‘Well, that’s one form of exercise,’ she said, half judgingly, making me and some of the others smirk.
‘I can’t believe they’re working out,’ Sue said, glancing at the group of boys who were each on a treadmill trying to outdo the speed of the others.
‘Why not?’ Thalia said. She had her back turned to them and made no effort to change that.
‘I get their point, really,’ Jaylynn commented. ‘I mean, I’d probably work out too if I was sure I wouldn’t be stuck in these clothes after.’
‘They’re going to smell, aren’t they?’ Sue said. ‘I’m glad I don’t share a room with them.’ The rest giggled, making the boys turn their head and almost lose their balance.
‘Who are they doing this for?’ Sarah asked. ‘They would pace themselves better if they were doing it for themselves.’
‘For Nicky,’ Jaylynn pointed out, making Nicky look at her in surprise. ‘They wouldn’t do it for you, 
Sarah, they don’t have a shot with me around. Thalia isn’t watching and me and Ashley are taken. Sue has her big bro looking after her and Eirin is – well…’ Thalia seemed taken aback by Jaylynn’s explanation, for which Sarah seemed to offer an apologizing look. Nicky got a naughty look in her eyes and got up.
‘Guys!’ she yelled at them, waiting for them to pay attention. She then suddenly put her arm around me and pulled me close, pushing her lips against mine. I gasped in protest and surprise as she lowered her hands to my ass and pulled me closer before I managed to push her off. A loud crash announced that Gary had tripped over his own feet and fallen of the treadmill. Luckily, this took the attention away from Nicky and I.
‘What the fuck was that?!’ I half-whispered, out of breath. Nicky looked at me, giggling and blushing slightly.
‘That wasn’t half bad, that’s what it was!’ she answered. I blushed too and slid down against the wall trying to disappear into it, all the happier that everyone seemed distracted. Tristan and David rushed over to Gary and so did both Sarah and Sue. Jaylynn looked at me amused and so did Simon as he wandered over to us still sweating and panting from his training.
‘I thought you had a boyfriend?’ he asked between breaths, unable to wipe the smile from his face.
‘Things aren’t going too well,’ I responded, trying to be cool about what just transpired.
‘So how is it that this is the second time today I see you being intimate with a girl?’
‘You didn’t see the first time, you only heard about that,’ I scolded. ‘Besides, I didn’t have much of a say in this, did I?’
‘Oh shush,’ Nicky said. ‘You loved it.’
‘So not the point!’ I told her. She burst out in giggles. 
‘I’m not judging, Ash,’ Simon continued. ‘I just didn’t know you were into girls like that. Last month at the party at our place your father said-‘
‘Well he’s kind of a dumbass anyway,’ I interrupted. ‘He’s clueless to why the pool boy really comes to clean the pool three times a week, too.’
‘Holy shit, are you saying he’s paying the dude to have s-‘ Simon started, but Jaylynn broke him off.
‘Oy! There’s little kids here,’ she said, looking at Simon angrily.
‘Sure, I can’t say the word, but Eirin and Reuben over there are totally fine with what they’re doing?’
‘As long as they keep quiet, I guess.’ She seemed unconvinced of herself.
‘He might just not care,’ Keith mentioned.
‘What, Simon?’ Jaylynn asked. ‘Obviously.’
‘No, Ashley’s dad. My father has my mother practice her tennis too often a week too. He says it’s healthy for the marriage.’
‘Up until they get pregnant off it,’ Nicky pointed out. ‘Then you get unloved bastard children like David.’ We all looked at him, realizing he did seem a bit depressed. ‘The rumors at school suggest he sacrifices chickens to Satan in his bedroom,’ she added.
‘Are those the same rumoring people that claim you’ll be eaten by ghosts if you stay in the gym after hours?’ I asked. I had never liked the high school rumors, nor the people spreading them.
‘That’s true though!’ Nicky exclaimed. ‘I’ve seen the ghost!’
‘So how come you didn’t get eaten then?’ Simon asked.
‘Too little brain to be tasty, I bet,’ Jaylynn suggested, making Thalia laugh.
‘That’s zombies, not ghosts,’ Nicky said, offended.
‘Right, my bad,’ Jaylynn said, unable to hold back her giggles.
All the commotion had ruined the mood for Eirin and Reuben. They had emerged from their shady corner, their tracksuits messed up  and Eirin’s long, dark hair was all over the place. Eirin approached us while Reuben walked over to the group around Gary, who seemed to be unconscious.
‘What happened?’ Eirin asked
‘Nicky and Ashley kissed and Gary lost his mind over it,’ Simon summarized. Thalia shot him an angry look.
‘Quite literally, it seems,’ Jaylynn added, looking at Sue and Sarah who were on their way back.
‘He landed poorly,’ Sarah explained. ‘We managed to wake him up but he has a nasty gash on the back of his head. He needs medical attention.’ I glanced over to find Reuben and Tristan waving at the cameras and pointing at Gary’s body. Gary seemed to mumble something but had a lot of saliva dripping from his mouth and I wondered if “awake” had been a proper description of his state.
‘Well, we’ll be picked up in about 30 min,’ Jaylynn said, pointing at the clock. ‘Mind you, they might just throw him back in his room and leave him be,’ she added.
‘I don’t think that’s fast enough, Jay,’ Sarah said. Sue nodded in agreement.
‘He’s bleeding a lot,’ she confirmed. Nicky backed away slightly, not unnoticed by Thalia.
‘Where are you going?’ she asked. I sensed a hint of judgment in her voice. Nicky seemed startled.
‘I eh, I dunno,’ she stammered, her face turning red.
‘This is your fault,’ Thalia told her.
‘That’s not true,’ I interfered. If it were, it would just as much be my fault.
‘I’m with Ashley on this one,’ sided Simon. ‘Yes they kissed but they didn’t trip Gary’s leg.’ Jaylynn sniggered.
‘Let’s not point fingers here,’ Sue said wisely, causing Keith to look at her with pride. ‘It’s not like it makes a difference, and we have more pressing matters.’
‘Right,’ added Sarah. ‘Does anyone have any medical experience what so ever?’ She looked around, but no one answered.
‘Well that’s just bloody perfect,’ she said annoyed, walking off towards Gary and the group standing around him. Sue followed her quickly with her brother and not much later Simon, Nicky and Eirin followed too, leaving Thalia with Jaylynn and me.
‘Did you like it?’ Thalia asked, completely unbothered with Gary’s state of being. Jaylynn giggled, but Thalia seemed very serious.
‘I don’t know,’ I told her in all honesty. ‘It happened rather quick, it’s not like I put much passion into it.’
‘Did she use tongue?’ She continued, still serious. Jaylynn, on the other hand, had visibly trouble not to burst out in laughter.
‘She sure tried!’ I answered, more to tease Jaylynn than to be honest. Thalia gasped and turned red, but was no further interested. 
Not much later the door suddenly unlocked and several guards entered, two of them pulling a stretcher. The guards seemed rougher than they had been over breakfast. Without talking they grabbed each of us and started dragging us back towards our rooms while no less than five guards lifted Gary and carelessly threw him on the stretcher. They tied him down as he screamed in pain and ran off with him, in a completely different direction than we were being dragged off to.
Once at our rooms we were thrown in hard. The door got slammed and locked behind us. Sarah lost her balance and fell as she was thrown in before me, but I managed to avoid her by jumping onto my bed directly.
‘Are you okay?’ I asked. She didn’t move.
‘I am,’ she answered. ‘I just don’t feel like getting up. Also, I’m hungry.’
‘Me too,’ I realized. ‘I wonder if we get lunch in here, too.’

We did not. The next time we were taken from our rooms was for dinner, leaving most of us rather grumpy. Once we were settled at the table, it was obvious Gary was not there.
Howard was, however. He was lazily resting his elbow on top of the TV that was still there, turning the remote over in his hand as he observed the rest of us take place. Tristan seemed somewhat lost; he was no longer sitting next to a guy but instead found himself amidst girls. Slightly annoyed, he turned to Howard.
‘How’s Gary?’ he asked. Howard seemed surprised that someone addressed him and straightened up before answering.
‘That’s no longer your concern,’ he finally said. 
‘It kind of is, now I’m stuck between girls.’ Howard rolled his eyes and lazily walked over to Keith and grabbed his nameplate, after which he walked over to Gary’s spot and switched them around. Slightly surprised, Keith got up and followed Howard back to his new spot, taking place between his sister and Tristan.
‘There, happy?’ Howard said, mumbling something about spoiled brats under his breath as he wandered back to the TV. He turned it on, displaying a paused screen of the news broadcast. It wasn’t a breaking new segment this time, but a recording of the regular news that had likely been on during our breakfast or while we had been in the gym. The broadcast showed the male anchor who was halfway through a sentence, and next to him a dark image with big letters in red saying “Mass Commack Kidnappings.”
‘I thought I would keep you up to date about the search for you,’ Howard said, chuckling slightly.
‘Where is Gary?’ Nicky asked, she felt guilty. Howard’s smile froze.
‘Suffering elsewhere,’ he replied. His voice seemed colder. Without another word he hit play on the remote, shutting up anyone else who might have wanted to voice their concerns about Gary.
“More news on the mass-abduction in Commack, New York,” the anchor continued his sentence. “Though there is no direct proof that the children have been abducted, the police have mounted a full scale investigation. The FBI are also on the case in order to get these kids back home to their families as soon as possible. - At the moment it’s unclear why they have been taken; no threats have been issued or ransom calls made. Parents and police alike are fishing to find out who took their children, and why. Speaking of fishing, on the matter of the cars used in these disappearances, the police have reported them found. They were found at the bottom of Willow Pond, near Commack.” The image next to the anchor showed how a crane was pulling cars out of a lake. There were a lot of police at the scene, as well as a young woman with a microphone in her hands. She looked into the camera and patiently awaited her turn. The anchor turned to the screen.
“Jane, what can you tell us?” the anchor asked her. There was a moment of silence before Jane started talking.
“Yes, Devon. I’m standing at the lake where all thirteen cars have been found. They are being pulled from the bottom as we speak. Meanwhile, the police is looking for traces in the few cars that have already come ashore, but they haven’t been able to find any leads yet. Fortunately that also means our missing persons are not in them.” 
“A bright note on a dark page, then,’ Devon commented. “What is their next step?”
“As you can probably see behind me, the cars have been stripped off their plates which means no clues there either. The police are scouring the lake with divers and the nearby area with dogs. While they’re still waiting for the ransom call, assuming this is an abduction, the police are reviewing some home security footage they’ve been given by the parents. So far, that hasn’t yielded much yet, but I will keep you posted on that.”
 “Thank you, Jane,” Devon answered. He turned back and looked into the camera before going on.
“The mayor of Commack, Thomas Greenberg, addressed the press on the matter this morning. Let’s take a look at that.” The entire screen switched to show the Commack town hall. There was a makeshift podium in front of it with a lot of microphones on it and Thomas behind it. He looked tired and saddened.
“What has happened here yesterday, is tragic,” he said, looking wearily into the camera. “Having lost my own daughter recently, I can imagine what these parents are going through. No parent should lose their child.” The camera shifted to the side slightly, showing our parents. I could see my parents had not slept much, nor had the parents of the others. Some of the mothers were crying quietly. The dining room grew restless: the teens responded to seeing their parents and the guards feared a possible riot.
‘Quiet down,’ Howard said, slightly worried as well. Jaylynn exchanged a look with her sister but they seemed calmer than the rest. I tried to figure out which parents were theirs, but had no luck.
“The parents of the victims have promised to provide the police with whatever they need, and so will I.”
‘I don’t believe him,’ Jaylynn whispered to me, making me miss the rest of Thomas’s speech.
‘Which part?’ I asked, pouring myself another coffee instead. Sue had started crying and was being comforted by her brother. Nicky seemed even quieter than she had been when the tape started and now that Jaylynn was talking to me, Sarah tried to cheer her up.
‘All of it,’ she said. ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if he was behind this.’
‘I don’t know,’ I answered. I glanced over at the TV again and noticed it had gone back to black, and Howard had vanished. ‘I didn’t know he lost his kid, though,’ I added, still looking at the black screen. Jaylynn nodded.
‘His daughter Margot, she offed herself about a month ago,’ she explained. ‘It was all over the news, I’m not sure how you missed it.’
‘I guess I spent too much time watching Arthur play. Why did she do it?’
‘Not sure,’ Jaylynn admitted, but Simon bend in to join the conversation.
‘Apparently she got bullied in school,’ he said. ‘To the point where she couldn’t handle it.’
‘That’s sad,’ I said. ‘But I doubt he’s behind this then. He’d be all depressed and this is set up pretty elaborately.’
‘Does explain why he seemed weary,’ Simon commented. David was having a conversation with Thalia, and instead of drowning in his thoughts he decided to join our conversation.
‘Are you forgetting that we did, in fact, get an official invitation for a buffet dinner at the mayor’s residence?’ Jaylynn pointed out. ‘What else could that have been for?’
‘They’re starting a massive anti bullying campaign,’ Simon told her. ‘After the summer. They were setting it up and wanted our opinions. My dad phoned the mayor to ask what the dinner was for. He thought it was suspicious.’
‘I guess it was,’ Jaylynn replied. ‘Bet he’s beating himself up about letting you go, now.’
‘One way to counter bullying would be to not just invite the rich and famous kids to a buffet meeting about anti bullying,’ I said absent-minded. Jaylynn blinked at me dumbfounded before responding.
‘Really? You’re doing this now? We’re knee-deep in abduction crap and you want to discuss anti bullying methods?’
‘I don’t,’ I assured her. ‘I’m just saying, he went about it wrong.’ David had ended his conversation with Thalia and bent our way.
‘Are you discussing the cars too?’ he asked.
‘No, we’re discussing anti bullying methods for school,’ Jaylynn replied. I threw her an angry look.
‘I’m just saying!’ I repeated, but she ignored me.
‘To be honest I don’t think the cars being found is that big a deal,’ she continued. ‘It’s not like they’re gonna lead to us. I’d be more interested in the investigation of Greenberg’s staff.’
‘Why’s that?’ Simon asked.
‘We got invited on the day of the event,’ she explained. ‘That doesn’t leave much time to set up something like this. I’m pretty sure whoever is behind this is either the mayor himself or someone working for him.’
‘I don’t see why he would do this? It makes no sense,’ David said.
‘There’s no way in which kidnapping thirteen people makes sense at all,’ Simon reasoned. ‘Especially with no ransom call or anything.’
‘That’s a fair point,’ Jaylynn admitted. ‘But it’s happened anyway. And there isn’t going to be any ransom call so we better figure out what the bloody hell is happening here.’
‘Why wouldn’t there be a ransom call?’ Simon asked.
‘There would’ve been one by now,’ Jaylynn answered. ‘Besides, they would’ve only taken one person and locked them up somewhere less pretty and less looked after. Trust me, I’d know.’ I looked at her.
‘Your sister mentioned that,’ I told her. ‘Do you want to talk about it?’
‘Not yet,’ she snapped. ‘But in due time if you have to know you will know.’ She hadn’t convinced me, but it seemed pointless to argue so I let it slide.
‘I’ve watched too many horror movies,’ Simon decided suddenly. ‘As in, ever scenario I run in my head about how this is going to end, it doesn’t end well.’ Howard had excused himself and left the room without us noticing. 
‘Oh, I have a fair feeling that this is going to end bad, Simon. Don’t worry,’ Jaylynn assured him.
‘That’s not helping,’ I told them. ‘We need to figure out who’s behind this.’
‘Why?’ Jaylynn asked. ‘It’s not like that’s going to change anything.’
‘She’s got a fair point,’ admitted Simon.
‘Actually,’ Jaylynn continued, more to herself than to us. ‘If this is going to end up badly, that means fighting…’ She gazed at her plate distracted.
‘Fighting who?’ I asked. She looked at me in surprise.
‘That’s the point, we don’t know. Either ourselves, or them, or someone else.’
‘I guess working out isn’t that bad a thing then,’ Simon said. Jaylynn looked at him judgingly, but he was right.
‘Yeah, I think I’ll be using that time more productively from now on. Provided we get more; this might be over by tomorrow.’
‘I wouldn’t count on that,’ I said.
