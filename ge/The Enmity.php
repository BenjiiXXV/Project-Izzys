In the days that followed people kept disappearing for hours on end. We would be able to hear them scream, somewhere far away.  They would come back at either breakfast or dinner, exhausted and wounded. Martin quickly made himself the second most hated person in the building, though Howard was only hated more because he was seen as the one in charge.
Other than me, only two other people had a finger cut off. Jaylynn lost her index finger and Tristan had his thumb cut off. He had joked about cutting Thalia’s tongue out as she remained the chattiest in the group even after the drama, but that suggestion had been met with a lot of angry faces. Thalia had quieted down a little after that, but nowhere near as much as Tristan did after he lost his thumb.
As the days passed we seemed to numb down. It became just a matter of going through the motions, as it was obvious we weren’t going to be saved anytime soon. We ate, exercised, waited, ate again and slept. Occasionally we would be dragged from the group to be tortured for hours on end. After the first week Howard stopped showing up every meal. After the second week he all but stopped showing up with the exception of Saturdays to show us the week’s updates on our abduction. He wouldn’t speak, but waited patiently until we sat down and went quiet. After the video he would leave the room, again without a word. He seemed to be losing a lot of weight and his face grew more pale every day, as if he was struggling with guilt. Jaylynn and I started wondering whether he was having second thoughts.
‘Maybe he’s getting Lima syndrome,’ Jaylynn opted one morning after Howard slouched off.
‘What’s that?’ I asked.
‘Isn’t that what you get from ticks?’ Simon asked.
‘No, that’s Lyme disease,’ Jaylynn corrected. ‘Lima syndrome is the opposite of Stockholm syndrome. It’s when captors empathize with their victims and end up letting them walk out.’
‘That’d be nice,’ I said, still gazing at the door Howard had left through.
‘It would,’ Simon concurred. 
‘No,’ David said, without leaning in. ‘And I don’t mean that as a “no that wouldn’t be nice” way, I mean that as a “that’s not what’s happening” way. He isn’t the one in charge.’
‘What makes you say that?’ Jaylynn asked, intrigued.
‘He’s a replaceable middle-man, has to be. No matter how many guns you point at us, it’s too dangerous to hang around a group of teens you kidnapped. Broken or not.’
‘Maybe he likes the sensation,’ Simon opted.
‘Yes, that totally looked like a guy enjoying his sensation,’ Jaylynn answered sarcastically. ‘So what you’re saying is-’
‘Lima or not,’ David interrupted, ‘He’s not gonna let us out. Even if he did grow some compassion and wanted to help, those forty-something guns are aimed at him too.’
I grinned.
‘What’s so funny?’ Jaylynn asked.
‘I’m sorry,’ I defended. ‘I just imagined Howard grabbing one of the Pajamas as meat shield and shooting out the rest...’ Simon and David grinned too, but Jaylynn shook her head.
‘You’ve been watching Arthur play too many games,’ she said, trying to hide her grin.

To my dismay, I noticed most screams stopped affecting me after a while, except for Jaylynn and Sarah. Whenever Sarah was taken I would curl up in a corner with my hands over my ears, trying to block the sound of her screams. A sense of helplessness would take over and I would cry, then get angry at both the people doing this as well as myself for not being in control of my emotions. Sarah had become more than just a roommate to me. She felt like a sister, and so did Jaylynn. Whenever Jaylynn would be taken Sarah could cuddle against me tightly, clenching at every scream. I would hold onto her, trying not to show that I needed those cuddles just as much as she did. Maybe even more.
Other than that, the days just dragged on. David was the only one who knew exactly what day it was, the rest of us lost track after a few weeks. Over time we grew more compliant and the Pajamas mellowed. According to Howard’s weekly news recaps, the public had more or less given up on us. They thought we would have been killed by now, and that it was just a matter of time before our bodies would be found like Gary’s. Over time we talked less and less. We ate our food without exchanging words or looks and I noticed over time people slouched more.
The only place where conversations still happened was in the gym, mostly because things kept changing in there. Every few days the equipment would be moved around or switched out overnight. After the first week loud, annoying techno music was added to the room, we assumed it was to mask the screams coming from the dungeons.
I mostly exercised with Jaylynn; we had the luck of not being separated the first month. Whenever one of us were taken was either the afternoon or night. When after about a month she was taken after breakfast and I was without her during our exercise period, I was confused and at a loss. Nicky noticed this, and approached as I sat on one of the stationary bikes.
‘Are you okay?’ she asked. She seemed nervous.
‘As okay as I can be, I guess,’ I answered. I wasn’t sure of her intentions, and the last time I had any interaction with her in this room people died. Nicky realized that too.
‘Look, I’m sorry,’ she said as she sat down on the bike next to mine.
‘For what?’ I asked, though I didn’t look at her. I kept my eyes on Sarah, who seemed lost without her sister but tried to stick to her workout routine anyway.
‘Gary,’ Nicky answered. I turned my head to look at her.
‘What happened to Gary was not your fault,’ I assured her.
‘If I hadn’t kissed you-’
‘Bullshit,’ I interrupted. ‘Your passion had nothing to do with it. He was checking us out way before then. It was only a matter of time before he would fall.’
‘But-’
‘Nothing to “but” about it,’ I insisted. ‘You shouldn’t let that get to your head. They killed him, not you. And if you start feeling guilty for it, that’s just in their favor.’
‘She’s right, you know,’ Thalia added. I jumped; she had approached from behind me and I hadn’t noticed over the music.
‘Oh, sorry,’ she added, noticing she startled me.
‘It’s fine,’ I said. ‘It’s not your fault I’m jumpy.’
‘Still,’ she said, unsure. An awkward silence followed.

‘You know what,’ Thalia continued after a while. She had been looking at Sarah. ‘I’m glad I’m here alone. As in, that I don’t have a brother or sister in here with me.’
‘Why’s that?’ Nicky asked.
‘I think I’d lose my mind worrying about them. Especially if they’re in different rooms being – you know...’
‘Are you saying Jay being tortured right now leaves you cold?’ I asked, but continued without waiting for her to answer. ‘I’ve come to care for them as if they’re my own siblings. If anything were to happen to them...’
‘I think at this point it’s more a matter of when anything is to happen to them,’ Nicky noted.
‘Not helping,’ I pointed out.
‘I didn’t mean it like that,’ Thalia said. ‘It doesn’t leave me cold, I just...’
‘I know what you meant,’ I said. Another awkward silence followed, and again Thalia broke it after a while.
‘Nicky, do you think we could talk? Like, privately?’ she asked. I looked at Nicky, Thalia did too.
‘Sure thing,’ Nicky responded. They got up and wandered off, Thalia talking rapidly. I suppressed my curiosity on what they were discussing and tried to work out some more before we were to hit the showers.
Simon approached me almost instantly, panting and soaked in sweat.
‘What’s the deal?’ he asked, nodding his head towards Thalia and Nicky, making sweat fly off it.
‘They wanted some one-on-one time,’ I said, pretending not to have noticed.’
‘Kinky,’ Simon commented. I rolled my eyes.
‘Not that kind,’ I assured him. I looked at the girls and noticed Thalia was blushing.
‘So what’s up?’ I asked Simon, trying to keep his attention away from them. He looked at me confused for a moment before answering.
‘Oh, right!’ he then said. ‘I’ve been training on the treadmill for a while, trying to see how long I can hold out. I can run a solid ten minutes before getting too out of breath.’
‘Right,’ I responded, unsure where he was going with this.
‘Couple of the guys are planning an escape kind of thing,’ he continued. ‘They think they can create a distraction big enough for us to make a run for it, so I figured I’d see how far I could get.’
‘Because running one speed on a treadmill is comparable to running through a house or outside with armed people chasing you down.’
‘Well, you know,’ he said, slightly taken aback, ‘at least it’s something. Right?’
‘I guess.’ He deserved credit for trying. ‘Either way, I think it’s a bad idea.’
‘Why?’
‘Because no matter what distraction you could have in mind, they’re armed, armored, and outnumber us three to one. These tracksuits aren’t gonna stop a bullet, you know.’
‘So you just want to stay here and accept your fate?’
‘Want to? Definitely not. But it seems to be the only option we have.’
‘You’re not even willing to fight for that slight chance of freedom?’
‘There is no slight chance!’ I was losing my patience. Surely Simon wasn’t really this stupid. ‘You’d have to make a freaking bomb go off on the other side of the house to cause a probable diversion and even if you did that they wouldn’t leave us unguarded. You can’t outrun their bullets!’
‘I’m disappointed,’ Simon stated. ‘I really thought you’d be on board.
‘Yeah, well, I thought you’d have a better plan,’ I said.’
‘Whatever. We’re gonna try this either way, with or without you. Your call.’ He tried to walk away, but I grabbed his sleeve.
‘Simon, don’t do this,’ I warned him. ‘You won’t make it.’
‘Don’t think I will either way, Ash. This doesn’t look to me like a situation we’ll get out alive. Why wait?’ He pulled his arm loose and walked back to the treadmill.

When Sarah and I found ourselves back in our room not much later, she sat down on her bed and looked at me with concern.
‘She’ll be alright,’ I told her as I crashed onto my own bed, looking at the ceiling. I assumed she was worried about Jaylynn, but I was wrong.
‘You didn’t even consider it,’ Sarah told me. I looked at her confused.
‘Consider what?’
‘I overheard you talking with Simon,’ she clarified. ‘His plans to mount an escape attempt, you didn’t even consider it.’
‘I think it’s a dumb plan,’ I defended rudely as I sat up straight and looked at Sarah. She was slightly taken aback.
‘What, you’ve got something better in mind, then?’ she jested. 
‘Just because I haven’t come up with a solid escape plan doesn’t mean that I have to indulge in a suicide plot.’
‘You said yourself that you don’t think we’re going to make it out alive anyway!’ 
‘That doesn’t mean I’m just gonna throw in the towel and die willingly,’ I told her. ‘I’m not against an escape plan but it needs to be solid and doable.’ Sarah seemed angry at me.
‘What are you like?’ she spat. I didn’t respond; I was unsure how to. 
‘You’re being awfully negative,’ she continued. ‘Are you gonna blatantly refute any plans?’
‘If they’re moronic, yes! With Simon’s plan we’d have more deaths than escapes and I’m not like David. I prefer not to sacrifice for my benefit!’
‘David doesn’t do that,’ she snapped. Something red shot through her eyes, and cheeks. ‘I thought you hated rumors like that too?’
‘Hang on, how do you know he doesn’t?’ I looked at her with one eyebrow raised and she started blushing more.
‘Oh my God, you like David,’ I concluded.
‘I do not!’ Sarah tried, but her face betrayed her. ‘Alright,’ she yielded. ‘Don’t tell anyone.’
‘What do you like about him?’ I asked, as neutral as I could manage. I wanted to change the subject. It seemed to work.
‘I don’t know,’ she admitted as she backed away into a corner. ‘He’s... He’s charming.’
‘Charming?’ I asked. Her definition of the word seemed to differ from mine.
‘Yeah, his looks and the way he speaks...’ She seemed to get lost in thought and her eyes turned dreamy. I got off my bed and joined her on hers.
‘You know what, you might be right,’ she said quietly. ‘I mean, I was all on board with Simon’s plan thinking I’d be one of the few that would escape but...’
‘You hadn’t considered that meant other people would die.’
‘I really hadn’t,’ she said. Her eyes teared up and she veered into my arms. ‘I’m so sorry,’ She started crying, and i tried to console her by patting her back. 
‘You don’t have to be, Sarah,’ I assured her. She held on tighter and I stroked her back gently.
‘Just – Don’t tell Jay, alright?’ she asked after a while.
‘You don’t want her to know about David?’
‘Not that, the part about the escape plan.’
‘Oh, I didn’t plan to,’ I lied.

I planned not to bring it up at dinner at all, but I’d forgotten I was seated right next to Simon who had all but forgotten about the way I’d treated his proposal. Worse yet, he’d gotten sour over it.
‘Why don’t you just join them?’ he said as soon as I sat down and the Pajamas had left.
‘Join who?’ I asked. I only paid half attention to him; Jaylynn hadn’t shown up yet, and though I know she probably wouldn’t until halfway through dinner, it made me feel uncomfortable. 
‘The Pajamas,’ he explained. ‘You like them so much, right? I bet their uniform would look amazing on you.'
‘That’s not fair,’ David interrupted. ‘Just because she saw flaws in your plans you’re gonna be a jackass to her?’  Sarah glanced at him, but saw that I noticed and looked back at her plate while going red.
‘It’s okay, David,’ I said. ‘He’s just proving that he’s not very mature; more reasons to not trust his plans.’
‘My plan was fine!’ Simon snapped, slamming his fist on the table.
‘Honestly?’ David started, but he shushed when Simon looked at him in fury.
‘What plan?’ Jaylynn asked. I hadn’t noticed she’d arrived, but she was sitting on her spot eating her food like she’d never been gone, though she spoke with effort. It seemed to hurt her to talk.
‘Simon had a plan to escape,’ I said lightly.
‘Really? Let me hear it,’ Jaylynn demanded. Simon started explaining his plan to her as I took a look her state. She moved slightly more careful when moving her hands. She kept her back straight and was breathing uneasily. It seemed the Pajamas had stepped up their game; it was no longer just burn marks on the arms and legs. There were fresh blood stains on her clothes, barely visible because of the color of the uniform but I could tell they were there. It made me reconsider Simon’s plan.
I knew Jaylynn well enough by now to know that she would willingly lag behind if it would ensure Sarah’s safety. I looked at Sarah, who was still red-headed and staring at her plate, but also glancing over at me and Jaylynn every few moments, worryingly. I wondered whether she was worried about her sister’s wellbeing or whether I would spill her secret, or perhaps both.
‘It’s stupid,’ Jaylynn concluded. I suppressed a faint smile. Simon’s face dropped.
‘Why is everyone so against freedom?’ he asked.
‘We’re not against freedom,’ Jaylynn and I choired. 
‘We just want a more solid plan,’ Jaylynn elaborated. 
‘That would take more time,’ Simon said. ‘And that means more torture.’
‘I can survive torture,’ Jaylynn said. ‘But I can’t survive your current plan.’
‘Why not?’ he asked. ‘I mean there’s a chance you’ll-‘ 
‘There’s not,’ I interrupted. ‘Even if she had a chance she’d give it up to get Sarah out.’
‘What she said,’ Jaylynn concurred. There was a look of pity in Simon’s eyes.
‘We have time, Simon,’ David clarified. ‘It’s better to take the time to come up with something that has a higher chance of success. As long as we behave properly, holding out a little longer won’t kill us.’
‘I’m not sure if I agree,’ Simon countered. ‘Gary behaved fine, yet he’s not here, is he?’ Jaylynn grabbed my wrist under the table and held it tight, forcing me to look at her instead of responding to Simon like I intended.
‘Don’t,’ Jaylynn told me in barely more than a whisper. Simon didn’t notice; David had commented on his remark and they were near argument. ‘It’s not worth it,’ she clarified. ‘And frankly, their opinions are twisted anyway.’
I looked at Nicky. She hadn’t heard Simon’s remark but did notice the stirring scuffle and grew cautious.
‘Keep it down,’ Jaylynn warned them. ‘You don’t want to draw attention to yourself,’ she added. Simon and David obeyed, albeit reluctantly. They refused to speak for the rest of the meal, both to each other and the rest, and chose to eat their food in silence.

Simon had been taken and tortured after dinner that night, which seemed to have wrecked any aspiration he had to revolt. It took weeks before he dared to bring his plans up again, but when he did all rationality seemed to be lost on him.
‘I’m done,’ he informed me one evening as we sat down for dinner. ‘I’m fucking done.’
‘Right,’ I said disinterested. I was glad to see he was doing better; he’d been more depressed lately and this newly found fire suited him more. I was sure, however, that he had no new plan and therefore didn’t care much for what he had to say. On top of that, I hadn’t slept much. We’d gotten adjusted to the lifestyle in here as far as possible, and though Sarah and I still shared a bed at night we slept fairly well over all. Last night, however, she’d been taken, and I’d spent the night alone trying to get through her screams and banging my head against the wall, trying to pass myself out. I’d woken up on the cold floor with a massive headache, blood marks on the wall and indubitably a black and blue forehead. The company had been polite enough to ignore it, but given the throbbing pain it didn’t make me a much nicer person. Jaylynn, though having similar doubts about Simon’s plan, was less evasive of the topic.
‘Do you have a plan?’ she asked him. ‘You know, a better one?’
‘Screw plans,’ Simon told her. He clenched his knife and had it pointed at her, right under my nose. ‘And screw your criticism,’ he added.
‘Careful,’ I warned him. He looked at me angrily.
‘I’m done with your attitude, Ash,’ he told me. ‘I think you like being here. I bet you’re loving the attention.’
‘What’s that supposed to mean?’ I asked.
‘I know about you,’ he continued with his knife pointed at me. ‘I’ve seen you at school. You always go unnoticed. Not popular enough to hang with the cool kids, not nerdy enough to hang with the nerds.’
‘Bullshit,’ I told him.
‘I know your parents don’t seem to care much either,’ he continued, hitting a nerve. ‘They prepped everything for your brother to take over their business, after all. Not for you.’
‘Don’t go there, man,’
‘So when two years back he was in that accide-‘ Before I realized what was happening or what I was doing my fist landed on his jaw while my other hand grabbed the arm with which he held the knife, pushing it against his own chest.
‘I said don’t go there,’ I repeated as he backed into his chair. I’d gotten up to get a better position towards Simon and Jaylynn had gotten up too, albeit just to pull me off in. I was infuriated; Simon had no right to speak of my brother like that. David got up too to prevent Simon from lashing back, but Simon was much stronger and shook him off without effort as he got up.
‘Or what, Ash?’ he said, intimidating. ‘Afraid people will believe the rumors?’ He was much bigger than me and pushed me against the table. Jaylynn now tried to pull him off me instead, but I refused to back down.
‘Do you know what it’s like?’ I asked him. ‘Do you know what it’s like to lose your brother?’ Simon was taken aback  by my fiery attitude and I used that distraction to push him back into his chair, aided by Jaylynn and David who thought they had to keep him off me. Jaylynn seemed unsure what to do; she believed I was in my right, but considered it unwise to act upon that. Simon dropped the knife.
‘What rumor?’ she asked him quietly.
‘I thought my parents cared,’ I continued. ‘I thought they were just fixed on Michael, but that they had a plan for me too.’ The other conversations at the table had died out and the Pajamas grew restless, knowing they were supposed to act, but somewhat curious to the story too.
‘And then I found out, they did not,’ I continued, trying not to tear up. I backed off slightly and allowed Simon to mend the matter, rather than to make it worse. David and Jaylynn noticed and looked at him strongly encouraging not to respond, but he chose to ignore them.
‘So you got the two of you into an accident and killed him,’ Simon responded. David and Jaylynn sighed. Jaylynn raised her hands and walked back to her chair while shaking her head while David sat back in his chair.
‘Whatever, dude,’ he told Simon. ‘This is beyond me, now. I tried.’ 
Contrary to their expectations, I backed off.
‘I do blame myself,’ I told him as I dropped myself back into my chair as well. ‘I mean, I probably distracted him, or something.’
‘It wasn’t your fault,’ Jaylynn tried to assure me, but Simon wouldn’t have that.
‘Of course it was,’ he interjected. ‘She figured out that with him out of the way the family fortune would be hers,’ he reasoned.
‘I loved my brother!’ I cried, barely able to hold back my tears. The memories still felt fresh. ‘And he loved me,’ I continued. ‘Even if my parents would’ve given him all, he would’ve shared it with me without a doubt.’
‘Easy to say, now that he’s dead,’ Simon blurted. I started shaking slightly, angry and trying to hold back my tears. I didn’t want to burst into tears for others to see.
‘Dude,’ David said, quietly. ‘Have some sense.’ 
Jaylynn forced through her pain to embrace me and console me while the others at the table tried to divert their attention; going back to the conversations, or suddenly unnaturally interested in their plates and silverware.
Simon collected his knife and threw it on the table, where it stood upright with its blade in the wood.
‘This is bullshit,’ he said angrily. He was ignored, which enraged him even more. Then he snapped.
Suddenly Simon veered up, pulled his knife out of the table and jumped onto me with the knife against my throat. The chair toppled over as Simon pressed me against the backrest, getting Jaylynn’s arm caught between and pulling her and her chair with us to the floor. Jaylynn cried in pain as we landed, Sarah cried in fear and I heard several of the others gasp. David jumped up right away to try and pull Simon off us while Jaylynn started kicking him and trying to free herself. I felt the knife cut into my throat slightly and then withdraw as Simon changed his hold to stab, rather than cut. He closed my throat with his forearm and attempted to shake David off while suppressing Jaylynn’s kicks, keeping her legs to the floor with his own. The Pajamas yelled something I didn’t understand, but David got off Simon and laid down next to me with his face down and his hands on the back of his head. At the same time I saw Thalia and Sarah get off their chairs too and lay down alike David had. I couldn’t see the others as the table was in the way, but I heard movement and assumed they laid down as well. 
The Pajamas yelled for Simon to drop is weapon, but instead he forced it through my skin, between my lower ribs. I struggled and cried in pain, but Simon pressed his arm harder on my throat to shut me up. I waved my legs and hit my fists on the ground, unable to cry for help. The Pajamas yelled a final warning and one of them fired his gun at the ceiling as I felt the knife dig deeper into my flesh. The debris landed on Simon’s back, as well as further out, making David and the girls flinch. Simon’s face had gone red and I realized he was stammering insults at me while ignoring the Pajamas and their warnings.
The gun fired again, closer this time. I closed my eyes, expecting more debris to rain on me, but instead I felt Simon’s roll off me as he gasped and groaned. The gun fired again and the room went completely silent as no one dared to make a sound and I kept my eyes closed, afraid of what I would see if I opened them.
It was one of the Pajamas that broke the silence.
‘Fuck, is he dead?’ the Pajama asked. I kept as still as I could and didn’t hear any of the others move either. I heard guns click and boots stepping closer as they carefully came to assess the situation. 
‘Fuck, he’s dead!’ the same Pajama confirmed, very close to me. One of the other Pajamas spoke rapidly in a language I didn’t understand and seemed to have a conversation, even though no one responded. I opened my eyes and looked at the ceiling, noticing the bullet holes. Not much later one of the Pajamas appeared, hovering over me, but ignoring me completely as he rolled Simon off me further. He looked back and chanted at the other Pajamas in the foreign language.
‘Believe it or not,’ he told me with a strong accent, ‘I’m sorry about this.’ I was too scared to reply. Several more Pajamas approached, lifted Simon, and carried him away as the Pajama standing over me knelt, putting his hand on my stomach and looking at the knife.
‘Now, as cruel as it seems, I’m going to leave the blade in you for now,’ he explained, looking straight at me. His eyes were a darker shade of brown than I had ever seen. ‘It will stop the wound from bleeding out too much. We’re gonna patch you right up.’ 
No sooner had he finished speaking or the dining room doors opened and footsteps hurried our way, along with a squeaking sound that turned out to be a stretcher. They rolled it up next to me. 
‘This is in your best interest, kid,’ one of the Pajamas said. He held a rag to my face with a very pungent smell. I struggled briefly, waving my arms and legs, but quickly passed out.
