/* Short part of a survival concept i wrote for a Lord-of-the-Flies kind of story. I have more on paper that i could consider taking over an putting on here, but this was enough for the most trusted members of my Betateam to veto the concept. */

We slept. Most of us, anyway,  as there wasn’t much else to do and for some reason driving for hours makes you tired. Even if you’re not the one behind the wheel. Perhaps it was just the ungodly hour we were at. However may be, most of us were asleep and those that were not kept quiet.
‘Don’t you ever sleep?’ Evanna asked. I noticed she had been observing me for a while, seated opposing me on the isle side. There were a few four-seat spots on the bus with a table, as opposed to the regular two-seat spots most people were forced to resort to. Evanna’s spot enabled her to observe me closely through her half-shut eyes without moving a muscle. Barely noticeable.
‘Nor you,’ I merely replied.
‘Touché,’ she said, failing to suppress a faint smile. ‘What’s on your mind?’
I looked at my little sister, asleep on the seat next to me with her face pressed against the glass. I glanced at the empty seat next to Evanna, where we had stased our backpacks, and at last rested my eyes on Evanna. She was pretty, I realized. It had been years since I had seen her for the first time, but I had never quite realize how pretty she was. Her long brown hair and her empathic, hazelnut eyes. Perhaps it was the way the light fell on her in the dimly lit bus. In any case, she was my sister’s girlfriend, not mine.
‘I’m not even sure,’ I finally said. ‘It’s not even that I’m not tired; I’m tired as heck, I just can’t sleep.’
‘It’s because of your nightmares, isn’t it?’ 
That much was true. Due to some rather traumatic events in my  youth - not that my youth was over yet -  I did have trouble sleeping.  At night I relived those moments, to then wake up out of breath, panicked, drenched in sweat and even more tired than I was before I went to bed. Evanna caught the look in my eyes and seemed to read my thoughts.
‘Let me be there for you, Ceth.’
I smirked. ‘You know how I think about that,’ I said, stroking my sister’s arm. ‘You just focus on making Autumn happy.’
‘That goes without saying. But alike her happiness is yours, yours is hers. And hers is mine, so yours is mine too.’
‘Is that your only reason then?’ I asked jokingly, after figuring out what she had meant.
‘Well, you know, there’s you generally being awesome and nice and saving my life and all that.’ She smiled, as did I. We had become good friends under a common goal.
The bus took an exit off the highway and came to a stop at a parking lot.
‘Your turn,’ Evanna casually mentioned as the rest of the bus slowly seemed to wake up. Some of them, anyway. I reached over the table to grab my wallet, got out of the bus, nodded my head to the bus driver that was now smoking a cigaret next to the bus and walked into the café next to the gas station we had parked at. As the others were still waking up, I was the first in line. I ordered two large coffee to go, knowing Autumn wouldn’t wake up, at the guy behind the counter who seemed to need the coffee more than I did.
‘Right then, I said as I returned and gave Evanna her coffee. She had switched seats with me, meaning I would now drive backwards in the company of your backpacks whereas she would enjoy the company of the sleeping Autumn.
We decided to play a cards game called ‘backpacking,’ a quick game that appears not to easily bore two insomniac teens with nothing else to do. You know, up until everything that could go wrong, did go wrong.

It was a near two hours since our last stop. The coffee cups had been emptied, trashed and replaced with open water bottles while Evanna and I continued our cardgame. The bus, which had been following a seemingly endless and straight stretch of high road ever since we had stopped, suddenly made a sharp left causing our water bottles to fall over. Evanna was quick enough to catch hers before it spilled, but I was less lucky and the contents spilled, flooding the game, table, our pants and the floor.
‘Eh, shit,’ I said. I took off my sweatervest and threw it onto the table as if that would help. Evanna got up to assess the damage and so did I, but the bus made another sharp turn throwing us back onto our seats and knocking over Evanna’s bottle, flooding the rest of the table, our backpacks, and Autumn. She slept through it, however, as did the rest of the passengers.
I tried making my way to the front of the bus to ask for some paper towels to clean up the mess. We weren’t far from the front, but given the driver’s new approach it was a challenge nonetheless.
