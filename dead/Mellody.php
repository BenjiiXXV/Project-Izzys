/*Crime story concept about the father of a girl that gets caught in battles with government agencies*/

‘Mellody, how‘re ye doin’?’ I asked, fully aware that driving while on the phone isn’t a good idea.
‘I’m scared,’ said the girl on the other side of the phone.
‘Ye don’ve to be,’ I lied. ‘Gran’s there, ain’t she?’
‘Well, yeah,’ she said, then continued in whisper ‘but what can she do if they are here?’
‘Ye underestimate her,’ I stated. ‘Besides, ye’re 200 miles out, I don’ think they’re gonna find ye.’
‘What if they find you?’
‘They won’t. I got rid of the minivan, the blue one ye hated so much, they can’t find me.’
‘How will ye ever pick me up?’ Mellody asked, terrified.
‘I bought me self a pick-up truck. One hundred and thirty six horsepowers, a four cylinder diesel and it’s...’
‘Dad,’ Mellody interrupted. ‘I’m nine, I got no idea what ye’re talking about.’
‘It’s scarlet.’
‘Scarlet?’
‘Red. Ask gran, she’ll show ye sometin’ scarlet.’
‘Sweet,’ she said. She went silent.
‘I’m scared,’ she repeated a while later.
‘I know,’ I answered defeated
‘When are ye comin’ to pick me up?’ she asked.
‘I dunno,’ I admitted. ‘When it’s safe, I s’pose. I gotta go, be kind to gran for me, kay?’
‘Kay...’
ONE WEEK EARLIER
It didn’t take long for me to notice something was wrong as I drove the ultramarine minivan around the corner and onto the parking lot of the elementary school. Mellody stood just outside the schools property, one foot against the wall and her face buried in her hands who were wet with tears.
As soon as she noticed I was there she ran for the car, opened it and jumped in the back without as much as allowing me to stop driving first.
‘Drive,’ she commanded.
‘Are ye mkay?’ I asked as I once more accelerated, but my question remained unanswered. In my rearview mirror I saw her look back at the school as I turned onto the road.
‘I hope they ain’t followin’ us,’ she said under her breath.
‘Who?’ I asked, sincerely curious as to who was terrifying my girl.
‘They wanted me,’ she answered as she checked the road behind us once more.
‘Who did?’
‘Federal bureau of investigation, child services, I dunno, they dropped many names. They said they’re gonna take me to a foster family.’ She talked to the rear window rather than to me, but suddenly turned around.
‘I don’ wantta go to a foster family, daddy, I wantta be with you,’ she said determined. Touched by her devoted love and paranoia I sped up some more and checked my mirrors a little more often than usually. That black Mercedes, how long had that been driving there?
‘I don’ like this car, I don’ like blue,’ Mellody said suddenly. In an attempt not to stress her out any further I grabbed onto the subject as if it was my only hope of survival.
‘Ye don’ like this blue or ye don’ like any blue?’ I asked patiently. A second Mercedes had appeared behind the first. It were big cars, wider than my van.
‘Any blue,’ Mellody replied as I turned into a small alley. The Mercedeses didn’t follow, the alley was too narrow. They blocked the entrance to the passage instead and a few men in suits with sunglasses got out and followed on foot. I sped up some more.
‘What colour do ye like then?’ I asked Mellody, no longer fully paying attention to the conversation. I fastened my seatbelt.
‘Red,’ she said as I turned out of the alley and missed an oncoming car by inches. It honked his horn and the driver shouted something at me, which I ignored.
‘That red,’ she added, pointing over my shoulder to the scarlet car in front of me.
‘I see,’ I answered as I passed the car and ran three red lights, turned left, turned right twice, middle fork, left, and finally right onto the street we lived in. Black smoke hovered over the houses in the distance, I had a bad feeling about it.
‘Fasten yer seatbelts,’ I commanded. Mellody, slightly terrified by the concerns in my voice obeyed at once. Then she gasped.
‘Our house!’ she cried. ‘Our house is on fire!’
‘Stay low, lay down on the seats.’ I didn’t wish to ignore my own daughter but at the moment it seemed the only way to ensure her safety. I quickly turned the car around and drove in the opposite direction.
‘Don’t move,’ I said, ‘An’ try not to make a sound. Hold on tight, it’ll all be over soon.’ A black Mercedes emerged from one of the alleyways on the left and started crossing the road. Rather than pushing the breaks, I held down the gas pedal. We accelerated, went faster, and faster, and - WHAM. Mellody screamed as I crashed our Toyota into the Mercedes but I immediately put the car in reverse, drove back, shifted to the first gear and drove off to the right, to the city borders.
‘Ye okay back there?’ I asked as I entered my fifth gear a few minutes later, driving dangerously fast and silently cursing on the fact that I still drove the minivan made for the cities rather than roads between them.
‘I’m fine,’ Mellody answered. ‘Where’re we goin’?’
‘Outta Fredericksburg,’ I answered, narrowly avoiding an oncoming truck, ‘And straight onto Weatherford.’
‘Why?’
‘I dunno if ‘t was the FBI or the child services at yer school, Mellody, but it could very well be possible that the same mudbugs destroyed our home.’ I slowed down, due to another oncoming truck I couldn’t pass the RV I was driving behind.
‘Either way,’ I continued, ‘they’re playin’ a foul game an’ I ain’t gettin’ you inta that.’ At last I could pass the RV. I was now followed by two Mercedeses and a larger van, which was black too. Only thing that could make the situation worse at the moment would be the sheriff doing speed checks.
‘So why Weatherford?’ Mellody asked as she climbed onto the front seat, against my wishes.
‘Yer grandmother lives there,’ I said as from the corner of my eye I noticed she at least had fastened her seatbelts. ‘And ye’re gonna live there too for the next couple of weeks.’
‘I don’ wanna go to grandma,’ said Mellody. ‘I wanna be with you!’
I couldn’t help but to smile at that. ‘I know, dear, and to make that possible ye first have to be at grannys for a few weeks ‘ntill things be settled.’
Mellody didn’t at all seem reassured by this but held silent none the less, knowing it had no use to argue.
Two hours later I parked the Toyota in front of my mothers house. We’d lost the van chasing us at Llana, and the last Mercedes at the Route 20, the rest somewhere in between. Mellody had fallen asleep while we drove through Stephenville and I looked at her enviously as I shut off the engine. I was going to let her sleep a while before I’d knock on my mother's door but she’d already seen the ultramarine van park in front of her house through the kitchen window and was now making her way over to the car.
'Jayden?!'
‘Shh, quiet, mum. She’s asleep,’ I whispered.
‘So that’s li’l Mellody?’ she asked. ‘How old is she now?’
‘Nine.’
‘So why have I never seen ‘r before?’
‘Because ye threw me outta the house ten years ago an’ I didn’t return as I lived 200 miles out.’
‘How’s Sarah?’
‘Dead.’
‘I’m sorry for yer loss. How’d she die?’
‘Givin’ birth to Mellody killed ‘r. Mellody has Sarah’s eyes.’
‘That’s nice.’
‘Yeh.’ There was a silence filled with unspoken feelings, blame and reproach and I wondered who hated who more. It was my mother who broke the silence.
‘Why arye here?’
‘There’s some mess with the FBI and I ain’t’ want Mellody involved.’
‘So?’
‘So I wondered if ye could look after ‘r while I sort things out.’ She gazed at Mellody for a moment, deep in thought, but at last answered.
‘Very well,’ she sighed. ‘I’ll take on her, and her alone, for Sarah’s sake and ye can’t enter me house.’
‘I’ll come an’ pick ‘r up as soon as things ‘re set,’ I said as my mother lifted Mellody out of her seat.
‘And for heavens sake, Jayden do something about yer car, it’s lookin’ like shit,’ she added. Without so much as a goodbye she carried Mellody into her house and closed the door. I started my engine and drove westwards, into Dallas where I hoped to stay with a friend now that my house was burned down.
Little over an hour later I drove onto his driveway on Basil street. My friend, Ethan Holly, had always been a little paranoid and I wasn’t surprised to see him come out of his house at once, a shotgun locked and loaded and aimed at my face.
‘Gerrof my lawn!’ he commanded.
‘Getta gun outta my face, Ethan, and greet me like the friend ye are,’ I answered fearlessly. At last, he recognised me.
‘JAYDEN!’ he bellowed. ‘Jayden! Man, it’ve been ages! How’ve you been?’
‘Been better, thanks,’ I replied. ‘Ethan, listen, me house got burned down so I need a place teh crash for the time being, can I sleep over here?’
‘Of course, man, come inside. I was about to head off for work though, gotta do a night shift today.’
‘Oh, where’re ye working now?’ I asked as I sat down on the couch and admired his huge flatscreen tv.
‘Dallas police department,’ he answered importantly. ‘Listen, I’ll be gone till tomorrow noon, so make yerselves at home while I’m gone, kay? Remotes for the tv are - I dunno really, somewhere below the pillows of the couch, I think. There’s a pc in the masters bedroom upstairs.’
‘Thanks,’ I said, as I got up from the couch and moved myself towards the staircase. Now I knew Ethan worked for the DPD, his house was no longer save either. The computer in the masters bedroom appeared to be a laptop, not even protected by a password. I searched for a cheap hotel nearby, and a gun store. Now that I was a fugitive anyway, I might as well protect myself.
I used my mobile cellphone to call a number that I found online. It seemed to be a sinister business though, and not fully trustworthy, but there wasn’t any reason for me to play by the rules now that I was chased by the FBI anyway. I’d become an outlaw, so I might just as well behave like one. The phone rang three times before it was picked up by a man who had a dark, low voice and spoke in barely more than a whisper, yet very firm.
‘Yes?’
‘Hello? Is this Mike Fildwire?’ I foolishly asked.
‘Who is this?’
‘I - I saw somethin’ about weapons fer sale online, it had this number?’ I thought it better not to reveal my name.
‘Yeah, yeah. Ye interested?’
‘Well, eh, I was wondering what ye had in stock?’
‘I can get ye anythin’ ye want,’ the man said. This was definitely not trustworthy business.
‘Can ye recommend me anything?’ At this, the man sighed.
‘New on the block, eh? Whatye want, big? small?’
‘Nothin’ too big, please, I don’t want the military to come chasin’ after me, thank you.’
‘Could hookye up with a nice handgun then. Conceal it nicely and nobody’ll ask about it.’
‘Ehm, okay?’
‘Meet me at the Bachman Lake Park, below Storey Lane, in one hour, come alone.’ The connection was broken. I quickly looked up the directions towards the mentioned place, wiped the browser history and got back in my minivan.
