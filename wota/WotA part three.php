[Part Three]

The clock struck twelve and the church bells rang as Lady Seren Velazquez crossed the Dam square. She ignored the numerous cyclists, causing them to swerve as they yelled at her while she entered the Kalverstreet. She walked slower than she usually would have done, but as the street had more people on a squared yard than legally allowed, she couldn’t go much faster anyway. After a while she reached a small, mostly hidden church that most people seemed not to notice. Their eyes would glide from the store on its left to the one on its right, as if the catholic building wasn’t really there. Seren entered it and walked up to the front rows where she sat down. A high-ranked police officer nearby finished his prayers and sat down beside her.
‘What has Andres done this time?’ Seren asked after a silence. They spoke in barely more than a whisper.
‘He killed seven people in the Portuguese synagogue at Waterloo square. Five tourists, no less. They were members of a group from Venice. The other two were a local tour guide and the rabbi showing them the synagogue.’ answered the officer.
‘Venice,’ Seren repeated slowly, trying to remember whether there had been any disputes with the light tribe there in the recent past. ‘How many of them were angels?’
‘How should I know?’ the officer responded, offended. ‘It’s not like you’ve stamped it across your foreheads.’ Seren smiled weakly.
‘That’s a fair point, I’m sorry. Do you know what happened yet?’ 
‘No clue. Nothing concrete, anyway. But according to a survivor Andrews had a shouting match with the rabbi and one of the tourists. That escalated quickly and – Well, seven people died.’
‘Any details on what the fight was about?’
‘None. I hoped you would know more.’
‘I’m sorry, I don’t,’ Seren admitted. ‘What of the survivor?’
‘He hurried back to Italy. Can’t blame him, the poor soul,’ the officer stated. Seren nodded in agreement.
‘Very well,’ she said as she got up, but the officer grabbed her wrist and forced her to sit back down. ‘Seren,’ said the officer concerned, ‘I won’t be able to cover him up much longer. The senseless murders have to stop.’
‘I’ll see what I can do.’
‘That’s not good enough!’ he exclaimed louder than he should have. Several people threw a disgusted look in his direction. Seren looked at him, intimidated and taken aback by his outburst.
‘What do you want from me?’ she said, her voice shaking slightly as she tried to hold back her tears. It were moments like these that her young age got the better of her.
‘I want you to fix this, Seren,’ he responded. ‘Either Mallory needs to start behaving properly or he should leave Amsterdam. He should be behind bars as is, and you know it.’
‘Well aware,’ she said, glad to realize she had her emotions under control. ‘But he’s not the only one and I can’t just send him away.’
‘Next time he drops a body, I’m taking him in.’
‘He’ll kill you,’ she warned him. 
‘Then he’ll have an even bigger problem,’ he assured her. ‘Besides, we’re not as defenseless against angels as we used to be. We’ve improved.’ Seren sighed.
‘You continue to underestimate us,’ she said. ‘You should know better by now!’ She pulled her arm free from his grasp and left the pews.
‘Don’t do anything stupid,’ the officer said as Seren walked out, ignoring him.



Enypheo’s office did not appear to have any source of light, nor did it have any windows, but it was not dark inside. Theodore sat in it, alone, wondering where the light was coming from. He was waiting for Mistress Enypheo to return from whatever she was doing. He rested his eyes, tired as he was. The nightmares had left him unrested, and he figured he would hear her approach. 
‘I stopped by your room on my way here,’ she suddenly said. Theodore was startled for a moment, he hadn’t heard her come in. Then he searched for a hint of emotion or opinions in her expression but found none which left him slightly disappointed. Then he noticed her eyes were the same piercing shade of blue as those of Evalyn, and now that he thought about it they had a striking resemblance with those of Luca, too. Theodore shook his head to shake off this thought.
‘I see,’ he answered, not sure what her intentions were.
‘The guards told me you had a nightmare,’ Enypheo continued.
‘Just one?’ Theodore asked, half serious. He’d spent years in therapy to forget some memories of his early childhood up to his sixteenth year. At long last he had overcome his traumas by convincing himself it had just been imagination going wild. His fantasies blurred with reality, or so he had assured himself, to create the weird images that plagued him. Perhaps he had watched a too scary movie or read a too exciting book to have his subconscious act up like that. It was the same reason he had stopped reading books, or so he told himself. What made him scared wasn’t this dream in particular, but the idea that other moments may reoccur to him as well. Moments he had come to deny ever to have truly happened. But at that very moment in Enypheo’s office he realized deep down he still remembered it all. That meant he knew more of the angels than he thought, and it dawned to him all the more that he didn’t want to recall all those memories.
‘Not those,’ he told himself as his mind seemed desperate to uncloak the rest of his youth. 
‘Not her,’ He thought as he drowned in thoughts while gazing into Enypheo’s eyes. ‘Please, please... Not..’
‘Luca...’ Theodore said her name with barely a whisper, not even aware that he had. His lower lip quivered as he remembered his little sister for the first time in decades. His eyes watered as he desperately tried not to cry.
‘I beg your pardon?’ Enypheo looked at him confused.
‘Nothing,’ Theodore muttered. Yes, Enypheo did have Evalyn’s eyes. And Luca’s.
‘Mistress Nagy, madam, can I ask you something?’
‘You just did,’ she replied with a slight smile. ‘But you can always ask me anything. I cannot, however, guarantee answers.’ She walked over to a nearby bookcase and seemed to search for a specific book.
‘Evalyn told me that nobody really knows what happened, but can you tell me what you know about the deviation of angels?’
‘As you wish,’ Enypheo answered. She stopped searching and sat back down in her chair, looking at Theodore. ‘Almost half a century ago, an angel called Dominick McGuire rode out on one of the last dragons to ever exist. They used to be more common, but in the name of protecting the unknowing a group of angels killed them all, one by one. Dominick had managed to hide his dragon, Abila, and one night he decided to end the needless murder of innocent dragons. He traveled to his sister-in-law, Lydia Pearsson, who was the leader of the dragon hunters. Using a mere sword, called “The One,” he beheaded her. After that, Abila set fire to their house. Lydia’s son swore eternal revenge on anybody to side with Dominick. All adults in his family were slaughtered and all children had their powers taken, to be left with traumas and oddities in their memories. But as Lydia had been a bitch, forgive my tongue, a lot of people sided with Dominick anyway. Nowadays the dark angels are led by Lydia’s direct descendant,  her son’s granddaughter, Seren Velazquez. As you can see, Evalyn did not tell the full truth, but she’s known to do that. She doesn’t lie, but she’s very creative with the truth.’
‘Dominick was my father,’ Theodore told Enypheo.
‘I’m well aware,’ she answered.
‘Which makes Seren family,’ he added.
‘Again, I’m well aware.’
‘So you’re asking me to kill my family for my father cause, instead of killing a stranger for my family’s cause?’
‘Essentially. I understand that it’s a difficult choice, but you must understand you’re free to make it.’
‘Free, as in, if I decide I’d rather support my alive family than my dead father I’ll never see the surface again?’
‘On the contrary. Should you decide that, which I hope you won’t, I’ll arrange passage to Amsterdam for you.’
Theodore looked at her, not sure whether or not he could believe her.
‘I need time to think,’ he decided. Enypheo nodded.
‘Take all the time you need.’


Paulina D’Angelo had never been to Amsterdam before, so she was a bit nervous while walking the unfamiliar streets. A feeling greatly enlarged by not knowing who to look for. She knew nobody, no foe, no friend. The fact that Achilleo Quadrelli had traveled with her was not much help; he knew just as much as she did. They had decided to pose as newlyweds on their honeymoon, as to not arouse suspicions with the locals, a role Achilleo enjoyed a little too much for Paulina’s taste.
They arrived at the Dam-square faster than they expected; Amsterdam was smaller than they thought. They had come about halfway across the square and Achilleo had just initiated another make-belief kiss when someone put a hand on their shoulder. They gasped and froze up, their ps still touching.
‘You’re acting suspicious,’ Seren said. ‘Calm down.’ The two did not respond, nor did they relax.
‘Paulina D’Angelo, right? And Achilleo Quadrelli?’ The two separated their lips and gave a slight nod, after which they realized that may not have been smart. Something warm entered their body through the hand on their shoulders.
‘I am Lady Seren Velazquez.’ At last, she calmed down, he heart rate went back to normal. Paulina turned around to kneel but was prevented from doing so by Lady Velazquez, who’s grip on her had tightened.
‘Forget about the formalities,’ she justified. ‘If people see you kneel now they’ll start looking. I don’t want too much attention.’ Paulina nodded. 
‘Prior to your arrival in Amsterdam I received word from Lord Severin Machiodi of Florence,’ said Seren as she started walking. Paulina and Achilleo followed.
‘You want to hunt down little Teddy, or so I’ve been told,’ Seren added.
‘Yes, I intend upon slaughtering him,’ answered Paulina.
‘Do you think you can get away with that?’
‘I do, he’s a mortal.’
‘True, but he’ll be guarded by angels. Untouchables, no doubt. Besides, rumor has it the McGuires are cursed, whoever kills the last...’
‘Meets death,’ Achilleo finished. 
‘The Grim Reaper,’ Paulina specified. ‘I do not fear him, Lady Velazquez. As I told Lord Machiodi, it wouldn’t be the first time for me to look into his blood-drenched eyes. I got away last time, and I’m sure I will again.’
‘So what of the angels you will come to fight on the way?’
‘They won’t be a problem, I’m an untouchable. Achilleo isn’t, but I got him covered.’
They had arrived at the grand central train station.
‘What does being untouchable have to do with anything?’ Seren asked.
‘It means anyone opposing me on my way to Theodore will meet their death,’ Paulina responded as if it was nothing. Seren looked into her eyes with concern.
‘I’ll assume you’ve never used your sun of death to kill anyone, then,’ she said, leaving Paulina confused.
‘What do you mean?’
‘Anyone who has ever used a sun of death knows that there’s severe consequences,’ Achilleo explained, making Seren look at him proudly.
‘Once a sun of death touches its target, the caster loses his prowess,’ she clarified. ‘It’s not a permanent effect, it only lasts two weeks. But when faced with an ascendancy, the sun of death is anything but a way out.’
Paulina swallowed, she didn’t know. Achilleo looked at her.
‘That’s why I’m traveling with you,’ he told her. ‘In case you use your sun of death prematurely and end up in need of help.’
‘I’m not that stupid,’ she snapped. ‘But thanks,’ she added in a kinder voice. 
‘Hunt down beloved Teddy McGuire and kill him,’ Seren decided. ‘That’s justified. Kill him without magic, if you can. It would save you a lot of effort when traveling home. Now, if you will excuse me, I have an appointment with Lord Mallory Andrews of Amsterdam. I’ve been informed he’s caught new fish.’
Seren turned around and left as the pretend newlyweds entered the train station in search for their train.
