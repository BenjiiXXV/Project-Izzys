Achilleo Quadrelli strolled down the Via del Castellaccio in Florence, late at night. He was on his way to the Giardino della Gherardesca, where an emergency meeting had been arranged by Severin Machiodi, the leader of the Florence tribe.
‘You’re late, Quadrelli,’ said Severin as Achilleo entered the circle the others were already in. There were ten others in the circle, all hooded carefully so they could not be identified.
‘Yeah, well, too bad,’ he replied under his breath. Severin ignored that as he addressed the group.
‘I have received word from Amsterdam,’ he said. ‘Nagy’s tribe contacted a mortal.’
The angels in the circle were confused and grew restless, but Severin ignored that too and continued as if he hadn’t noticed.
‘Nagy, however, did not contact just any mortal. She contacted Theodore McGuire.’
Several angels yelled at Severin in rage or expressed their worried. Achilleo remained calm and walked over to Severin.
‘I thought the McGuires had extinct?’ Achilleo said.
‘As did I,’ Severin answered. ‘Mallory was tasked with that. Apparently he wasn’t thorough enough.’
‘So what are we gonna do?’
‘Lady Velazquez was having trouble controlling her men, obviously. That means we have to interfere.’
‘Interfere? With  what?’
‘That McGuire is going to be a problem if we leave him be. Don’t say you’ve forgotten about the prophecy?’
‘I haven’t, I just never believed it. Won’t Nagy have him well secured?’
‘Nor I, but Seren seems to believe in it and apparently so does Nagy. As for the security, I’m hoping she’s relying primarily on the McGuire curse; whoever kills the last McGuire dies a terrible, terrible death.’
‘Mallory Andrews is still alive, that never surprised anyone?’ said Achilleo. Severin smiled.
‘Apparently not. Honestly, I kind of figured he found a way around it.’
‘Yeah, he did,’ Achilleo realized. ‘Letting somebody else finish the job.’
‘I can do it,’ said a female voice on Severin’s other side. Both Severin and Achilleo had been aware of the girl overhearing their conversation, she had been one of the few still on the square now that most of the other had made themselves scarce. They hadn’t bothered to interrupt her from listening in, mainly because she hadn’t bothered to interrupt them.
‘Paulina D’Angelo,’ Severin said slowly, still smiling.
‘The one and only,’ she replied while stepping closer to properly join in on the conversation. ‘I can take down that McGuire guy for you, it won’t even be a challenge.’
‘Paulina, what part of “terrible, terrible death” didn’t you understand? The “terrible, terrible” or the “death”?’ Severin emphasized.
‘Oh please,’ Paulina defended. ‘I’ve fought the Grim Reaper before, I’ll gladly do it again. You seem eager to stop me, mister Machiodi. Are you trying to save the last McGuire? Or are you madly in love with me?’ Achilleo laughed and Paulina giggled, but Severin looked as if he was about to shoot fire from his eyes. When he responded, however, it was calm and untouched.
‘Very well, D’Angelo, travel to Amsterdam and discuss things with Lady Velazquez. Only if she thinks you’re up for it you will travel further to Cambridge and take down McGuire. And take Quadrelli with you.’ 
‘Wait what?’ Achilleo defended. ‘Why me?’
‘Someone has to make sure she doesn’t get in trouble,’ Severin reasoned. He looked into her big brown eyes.
‘Please come home safely, I’d hate to lose you too.’ After that he turned around and left, leaving Achilleo and Paulina to get properly acquainted.


At the same time Venice, not far from Florence, travel arrangements were also being made.
‘You summoned me, Master De Lungelo?’ said a girl as she knelt in a dark alleyway near the train station.
‘I did summon you, Vanna, and I am glad you could come on such short notice,’ Master De Lungelo answered.
‘I wasn’t doing anything else,’ she lied. ‘Why did you summon me?’
‘Your expertise is called upon,’ Master De Lungelo said with a glance at a small blade barely visible beneath Vanna’s clothing. It distracted him. ‘In Barcelona,’ he added.
‘Barcelona?’ A look of dismay appeared on the girl’s face. ‘Isn’t that dark tribe territory?’
‘Not anymore. We pushed them back to their camp in Madrid a few years ago. You were there during that fight.’
‘Don’t think I have forgotten about that,’ Vanna snapped. ‘I lost my brother during that fight. I just thought they’d have re-conquered it by now.’
‘They haven’t,’ he said. ‘They went west and took Lisbon and Porto instead.’ 
Vanna was confused.
‘Why do you want me to go to Barcelona if it’s deserted?’
‘I presume you have heard of the dragon Abila?’
‘Naturally,’ she responded. Her eyes twinkled in excitement. ‘It was the dragon Dominick McGuire rode when he beheaded his sister-in-law, Lydia Pearsson, everybody knows that. It’s the very reason there’s dark and light tribes nowadays and not just angels all around the world killing each other for no apparent reason.’
‘Exactly.’ Master De Lungelo smiled. He liked Vanna’s desire to show off her knowledge. ‘The Cambridge tribe has a McGuire in their midst while we speak. They intend upon using him to finish off Lady Seren Velazquez of the dark tribes. 
‘It’d be more sensible for me to go to Harwich then; being a light tribe. I assume the fight will take place near there. Barcelona is deserted, what use would it have to go there?’ Vanna said. ‘Besides, I thought all McGuires were banned and stripped from their powers, aren’t they essentially just mortals now?’
‘Yes, they are, which is why it suits the prophecy so well,’ De Lungelo replied. Vanna blushed, she’d forgotten about the prophecy.
‘So why do you want me in Barcelona?’
‘You’re the best I got, Vanna. The dark tribes made dungeons below Barcelona, in which they stored their goods and weaponry, but also the dragon Abila. Now, Abila is dead, but before she died she laid a dozen eggs, which hatched just after we pushed the dark tribes out of Barcelona. All of her hatchlings died except for one female, which we named Jacinta. It was discovered shortly after the hatch by one of our scouts. Jacinta had eaten all her brothers and sisters. We left it there as we couldn’t use a dragon at the time, but Nagy says the McGuire gains powers from riding a dragon. She’s send one of her people to find the legendary sword and required of me to send somebody to seek the dragon.’
‘So you want me to seek the dragon?’
‘Exactly. We need to know whether or not Jacinta is still alive. A lot can have happened in two years.’
‘I will do as you command, Master De Lungelo,’ Vanna said, kneeling again. ‘How do I get into the dungeons?’
‘Once you get into the city, get to the Calle de Santa Ana, there’s a small pharmacy in that street. Ask for Elliot. They’ll bring you to the dungeon entrance.’
‘What if I find the dragon alive?’
‘Fly to Cambridge.’ Master De Lungelo smiled. ‘I know how much you love flying.’


Theodore McGuire had been given a room to stay in during his training prior to the final battle. As he was no angel and didn’t have access to any kind of magic, the training was an essential phase of the plan. Mistress Enypheo Nagy reasoned that without enough experience in battle he wouldn’t be up to his task. He’d just finished his training for the day and was thoroughly exhausted when he got back to his room. Admittedly, he hadn’t gone straight back to his room after training. He’d gotten lost, and ended up wandering through the corridors of the underground lairs for several hour before he eventually ran into Mistress Enypheo, one of the now three faces he knew in the hundreds that seemed to be around. A mere two minutes later they were already back at his room, which also happened to be the only room which door was guarded. The room had only what it was required to have, a bed, a bedside table, a comfortable chair, a bookcase and a closet for his clothes. He bothered not to unclothe himself but dropped onto the bed, which was so unexpectedly soft that he fell asleep at once. Memories of his long forgotten childhood came back to him and showed him things he had come to discard as mere fantasies.
<i>‘Dad?’ Little Theodore observed from his bed how his father was putting on his coat, only to pause and turn to him slowly upon hearing his son’s voice. He walked over and knelt at Theodore’s bedside, whispering quietly.
‘Go back to sleep, Teddy,’ he said while running his through Theodore’s hair. ‘I’ll be back before dawn.’
‘Where are you going, dad?’ The father gazed into Theodore’s eyes for a moment and the reflection of the moon in them before he answered with a sigh.
‘Nowhere for you to concern yourself with, son. Go back to sleep.’
‘But...’
‘I don’t want to wake your sister and mother as well,’ his father interrupted, slightly annoyed. He gestured behind him where Luca was still sound asleep, next to the door leading to the masters bedroom. ‘I’ll be back before dawn, Theodore, I promise. Now go the fuck to sleep!’ Theodore looked at him, unconvinced.
‘You’re not coming back are you?’ he said slowly, and disappointed. The father spawned a tiny ball of bright purple fire that lit up the room and floated an inch above his hand. He placed it on the wooden bed-side table and put a glass over it preventing any oxygen to get near. The fire didn’t extinguish, however. Nor did the bed-side table catch on fire. Theodore admired the tiny sun for a moment until his father continued to speak. When he did, he no longer sounded annoyed, nor slightly angered. He spoke with a caring whisper, one that a father can only use to his son, and only when his son needs it most.
‘I will always come back, Theodore. I promise you that. And until I do, this purple sun will remind you and Luca of that promise. As long as this sun shines, I will always come back.’ He kissed his son, arose, kissed his sleeping daughter too and  left the house.</i>
‘Mister McGuire! Mister McGuire, sir, are you all right?’ Theodore opened his eyes and looked into two hazelnut-brown, concerned eyes.
‘Are you all right, sir?’ the guard repeated. ‘Who’s Luca? You screamed for her!’ Theodore, who was soaked in sweat and strangled in the blankets on which he had fallen asleep, tried to sound casual in his reply.
‘Yes, thank you,’ he said, realizing he was breathless. ‘Just had a bad dream, that’s all.’
The guard looked at him for a moment and seemed to look right through his lies.
‘Sounded like more than that,’ the guard said. ‘However, it’s not my place to judge you. Perhaps you should speak with Mistress Nagy about this.’ He turned around without waiting for a response and walked back to his post, leaving Theodore behind with mixed feelings of fear and guilt as he tried to wrestle out of his blankets.
