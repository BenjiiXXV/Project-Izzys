The first abnormalities occurred as Theodore McGuire traveled from London to Cambridge by train. Not far from his destination a young woman took seat across from him while the rain started to clatter on the windows. He stopped his gazing out of the window now that the rain blurred the views anyway, and gazed at the new presence instead; intrigued and mildly amused at the sight of it. She had long, white-blond hair with a slight curl and mesmerizing blue eyes which she used to look back at Theodore shamelessly. A long, black coat finished the mystique of her appearance by contrasting her face so severely but fitting in with the rest of her wear. It seemed made for a purpose far darker than a mere train passage, and for a split-second Theodore wondered if he was about to become a hostage. Lightning bolted across the sky as the girl spoke.
‘You are Theodore McGuire,’ she said. It wasn’t a question. Her eyes seemed to penetrate his very soul and look into every corner of his memory. Theodore wasn’t sure what to say, astonished by the fact that she knew his full name; he had solely been called Ted for the past twenty years.
 ‘I’m Evalyn Skye, pleasure to meet you. You’ve never seen me, and you don’t know who I am,’ she assured him, answering the unspoken questions.
‘Please, the pleasure is all mine,’ he mumbled while trying to figure out what was going on.
‘I wouldn’t be so sure of that if I were you,’ she mentioned with a dark smile. ‘I need your help, mister McGuire. Or, better yet, my mistress requires your help.’
Theodore laughed, ignoring the looks of disgust and anger shot at him by both Evalyn and some of the other passengers. The train pulled into Cambridge Station and started slowing down. Evalyn looked out of the window worried and impatient.
‘My help?’ Theodore asked skeptically. ‘Your mistress requires my help? What could she possibly need me for?’
‘We need the intelligence and views of a mortal, mister McGuire. Mortals have a different way of approaching matters.’
‘You need a... what?’
‘A mortal!’ She spoke faster as the train slowed down more and seemed annoyed with the need for explanation.  ‘You know, somebody who can die? Apparently, your mortality boosts your survivability in some way,  blesses you with knowledge the immortals cannot possess.’
The train had stopped, and people entered the train.
‘Wait, are you saying you’re immortal? As in, not human? What are you, then?’
‘It’s getting too crowded,’ said Evalyn, as she looked around suspiciously and got up. ‘Meet me at the lamppost in the center of Parker’s Piece at midnight. Don’t be late.’ She disappeared as Theodore got up quickly and left the train.

‘You’ve made a mistake, Mallory.’
Two men walked in a quickened pace through the Herengracht in Amsterdam
‘I know that, Brian, I know,´ Mallory replied annoyed, he was less than pleased with his current company. He quickened his pace and so did Brian.
‘How are you going to explain that to Lady Velazquez?’ Brian asked. Mallory sighed and then answered without giving Brian a glance.
‘Unlike you, Brian, I do not fear Seren.’
‘Mallory, you shouldn’t have done that!’ Mallory stopped walking and turned around fast.
‘Listen, Brian,’ he said, pointing a finger at him. ‘You weren’t there, you don’t know what happened.’
‘It doesn’t matter what happened!´ Brian defended as he stepped back. ´You´re never allowed to use magic against mortals, or in the presence of the unknowing!’ 
‘Unless it’s a life threatening situation.’
‘You’re immortal, you have no life threatening situations.’
‘Yet we can die!’ Mallory snapped. He turned back around and continued walking. ‘Brian, I’ve been in service for nearly twenty years now. I’ve been in service longer than Lady Seren Velazquez has been alive. I think I know fairly well how to handle this, thank you. All you have to do is keep that big mouth of yours shut tight.’ He stopped walking and knocked on one of the doors.
‘The carpenters are here,’ he said. They entered the house and continued to the basement, which revealed itself to be bigger than the house had looked from the outside. It had the size of a small cathedral. In the back of the dimly lit basement stood a desk with a big chair, on which sat a woman: Lady Seren Velazquez.
The men approached Lady Velazquez and knelt.
‘Arise,’ she said. Her voice revealed that she was rather young. Her dark clothing and the dimly lit basement concealed most off her identity, though the her emerald-green eyes reflected the little light that was there, and they looked angry. The men arose.
‘I hope you bring good news, Andrews,’ Lady Seren told Mallory. ‘Your last few visits were filled with unsatisfying facts and were therefore a thoroughly disappointing and pathetic display.’
Mallory smiled awkwardly.
‘Surely I am more than a mere disappointment to you, Lady Velazquez?’ he said. It didn’t help.
‘Bring me your news, Mallory, I am starting to get impatient.’
‘Evalyn is on the move,’ he told her.
‘Evalyn is a mere pawn in the Nagy’s foul play. Why would she matter the slightest bit?’
‘She contacted a mortal, my Lady.’ A look of fear shot through Lady Seren’s eyes but she recovered quickly. After a short silence she spoke, there was no trace of fear to be found in her voice.
‘Anything else I want to know?’
‘It was a McGuire, Lady Velazquez,’ Mallory added. Seren looked at him with surprise.
‘I thought you killed all McGuires? I ordered you to kill all McGuires a long time ago!’
‘Yes, milady. You did,’ Mallory admitted. ‘I guess I failed.’
‘Another item for the alarmingly fast growing list of disappointments,’ she said with a sigh. ‘Very well. Brian, what news do you bring?’
‘A report of inappropriate use of magic, Lady Velazquez,’ answered Brian. Seren rested her eyes for a moment.
‘Well come on then,’ she finally snapped. ‘We’re not getting any younger either, spit it out! Who was it, and what was done?’
‘It was Mallory, my Lady. People have died.’

It was nearing midnight as Theodore approached the lamppost in the center of Parker’s Piece. He was feeling quite nervous; he didn’t know what to expect. The meeting spot was good, however. As Parker’s Piece was not much more than a well-lit field of grass, you could see anyone come from far away. It surprised Theodore that Evalyn wasn’t yet there, he didn’t think she was the type to be late.
And she wasn’t. At the precise moment he heard the church bells announce midnight, the girl appeared from behind the lamppost. Theodore wondered how he had failed to see her coming. Something strange was going on.
‘Mister McGuire,’ she said.
‘Please, call me Ted,’ he answered.
‘Very well, Theo, please follow me.’ She took off to Regent Street in a rapid pace, but Theodore could easily keep up.
‘Before I can bring you to my Mistress there are a few things I have to explain,’ Evalyn said.
‘I’m listening,’ Theodore replied. He wondered what in the world was wrong with him, following a stranger in the dead of night to an unknown place for an unknown reason. Yes, her mistress needed him for some reason, but he didn’t know this mistress.
‘As you may have guessed by now, I am not a mortal,’ she explained. ‘I am an angel.’
‘Nonsense. Angels do not exist.’
‘You don’t have to believe things for them to be real, Theo,’ she said with a sigh. She’d had this conversation before. ‘As well as things don’t have to be real for you to believe in them.’
‘So where are the wings and halo?’
Evalyn stopped at once, turned around and looked straight into Theodore’s eyes, infuriated.
‘Mind that tongue, Ted. I may not be able to fly, but I can kill you with ease.’
‘That doesn’t sound very angelic,’ Theodore commented as Evalyn continued walking.
‘Angels don’t exactly work in the traditional sense that you were lead to believe,’ she  said as if her outburst had never happened.
‘I don’t believe in angels,’ he reminded her.
‘Yet you started about wings and halos. Like I said, the traditional sense.’
The two went into a nearby restaurant where Evalyn exchanged a quick word with one of the employees. They followed the employee to the back, through the kitchen, where he opened the walk-in freezer. Evalyn stepped inside and Theodore followed, trying his hardest to appear like he was used to this kind of thing. The employee nodded and closed the door behind them. At once the floor turned into a staircase going down into an unlit hallway. Evalyn and Theodore climbed down as they continued their conversation.
‘As I said, I’m an angel,’ Evalyn said. ‘As is my Mistress, as are many others.’
‘Very well,’ Theodore answered, carefully avoiding making more mistakes. ‘Where do I come in?’
‘A few decades ago something happened. I have no idea what, exactly, but the result is that there now are two kinds of angels, dark and light. They battle each other every now and again.’ Theodore gave up on remembering where they were walking as Evalyn’s story was a lot to wrap his head around.
 ‘We’re all angels. We’ve all been trained the same way and know the same tricks, so usually it’s a long messy battle without a clear result. Every time a lot of angels switch allegiance and both parties spend a lot of time figuring out their new numbers. The McGuire's had something to do with the angelic deviation and my mistress, miss Nagy, thinks you can aid us in defeating the dark angels for once and for all.’
‘So it had nothing to do with just needing a mortal, then,’ Theodore said. ‘You needed me, specifically.’
‘I wasn’t sure what the best way was to convince you to come,’ Evalyn admitted. ‘But yes, we need you, specifically.’
They had arrived at a massive, oak-wooden door which opened itself and granted the two access into a small chamber containing several bookcases, a fancy desk with matching chair, and a red rug. Another young woman, barely older than Evalyn must be, was absent-minded floating hither and thither between the bookcases behind the chair while holding an open book with one hand that she was reading intensely. It could only be Mistress Nagy. Theodore noticed that both her clothing matched and her hair matched that of Evalyn and he wondered if they were family.
‘I thought you said angels couldn’t fly?’ whispered Theodore admiring. He started to notice small detailing on Miss Nagy’s coat which Evalyn’s coat lacked; Nagy’s wear was of better quality.
‘All I said was that I couldn’t,’ Evalyn whispered back. ‘Some can, you can learn to. I just never did.’ She cleared her throat.
‘Miss Nagy, madam. I have returned.’
The floating lady looked up from her book and closed it while she glided into her chair.
‘So I see,’ she answered. Her voice was calm and soothing, and far more matured than Theodore expected. ‘Mister McGuire, please, sit down.’
Two more chairs appeared from thin air and Theodore sat down in one of them, once again amazed.  They were made from solid stone, but shaped in such a way that they were surprisingly comfortable. Evalyn remained unseated. She struck a military pose; her hands behind her back, her feet slightly apart and her chin up, awaiting further orders.
‘Allow me to introduce myself, mister McGuire. I am Enypheo Nagy, honored leader of the light tribes.’
‘Tribes, madam?’ asked Theodore.
‘I don’t know how much Evalyn has explained, but knowing her efficient ways it can’t have been much. I’m sure she told you that we are, in fact, angels. Furthermore I presume she briefly covered the deviation.’ Enypheo glanced at Evalyn who nodded slightly.
‘There are many of us,’ Enypheo continued. ‘All scattered across earth and tied to different cities, which form different tribes.’ She pointed at a globe on the desk, and Theodore noticed it had a lot of small lights. Some were unlit, some were flickering and some were plainly lit in a variety of colors.
‘The red lights are dark tribes, the blue ones are light tribes like ours. Flickering lights imply contested zones, no light implies deserted zone. The white one is our capital, Cambridge, and the purple one is theirs, Amsterdam,’ she quickly explained. ‘Feel free to forget all that, I doubt you will be using it.’
‘Right,’ Theodore answered, realizing he already had. ‘So where do I come in?’
‘That’s actually quite simple, theoretically,’ she replied. ‘I intend upon either reuniting the two factions or wiping them off the surface completely. I can’t just go on a killing spree, and killing their  leader won’t suffice either way because a leader can be replaced. However, if the supreme dark leader died a truly humiliating death it will make a lot of angels to forsaken their cause and join ours. And the most humiliating death I could think of is for her to be killed by…’
‘A mortal,’ Theodore finished. It was predictable. He looked at Evalyn, who was still standing, but she showed no emotion. Enypheo smiled kindly.
‘Yes,’ she admitted.
‘But why not anyone else? Why specifically me?’
‘It’s what the prophecy foretold.’
